# Subtitle J—Prevention of Terrorist Access to Destructive Weapons Act of 2004

SEC. 6901. SHORT TITLE.

This subtitle may be cited as the ‘‘Prevention of Terrorist Access to Destructive Weapons Act of $2 0 0 4 '$ .

SEC. 6902. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following findings:

(1) The criminal use of man-portable air defense systems (referred to in this section as ‘‘MANPADS’’) presents a serious threat to civil aviation worldwide, especially in the hands of terrorists or foreign states that harbor them.

(2) Atomic weapons or weapons designed to release radiation (commonly known as ‘‘dirty bombs’’) could be used by terrorists to inflict enormous loss of life and damage to property and the environment.

(3) Variola virus is the causative agent of smallpox, an extremely serious, contagious, and sometimes fatal disease. Variola virus is classified as a Category A agent by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, meaning that it is believed to pose the greatest potential threat for adverse public health impact and has a moderate to high potential for large-scale dissemination. The last case of smallpox in the United States was in 1949. The last naturally occurring case in the world was in Somalia in 1977. Although smallpox has been officially eradicated after a successful worldwide vaccination program, there remain two official repositories of the variola virus for research purposes. Because it is so dangerous, the variola virus may appeal to terrorists.

(4) The use, or even the threatened use, of MANPADS, atomic or radiological weapons, or the variola virus, against the United States, its allies, or its people, poses a grave risk to the security, foreign policy, economy, and environment of the United States. Accordingly, the United States has a compelling national security interest in preventing unlawful activities that lead to the proliferation or spread of such items, including their unauthorized production, construction, acquisition, transfer, possession, import, or export. All of these activities markedly increase the chances that such items will be obtained by terrorist organizations or rogue states, which could use them to attack the United States, its allies, or United States nationals or corporations.

(5) There is no legitimate reason for a private individual or company, absent explicit government authorization, to produce, construct, otherwise acquire, transfer, receive, possess, import, export, or use MANPADS, atomic or radiological weapons, or the variola virus.

(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this subtitle is to combat the potential use of weapons that have the ability to cause widespread harm to United States persons and the United States economy (and that have no legitimate private use) and to threaten or harm the national security or foreign relations of the United States.

# Subtitle A—Diplomacy, Foreign Aid, and the Military in the War on Terrorism

SEC. 7101. FINDINGS.

Consistent with the report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, Congress makes the following findings:

(1) Long-term success in the war on terrorism demands the use of all elements of national power, including diplomacy, military action, intelligence, covert action, law enforcement, economic policy, foreign aid, public diplomacy, and homeland defense.

(2) To win the war on terrorism, the United States must assign to economic and diplomatic capabilities the same strategic priority that is assigned to military capabilities.

(3) The legislative and executive branches of the Government of the United States must commit to robust, long-term investments in all of the tools necessary for the foreign policy of the United States to successfully accomplish the goals of the United States.

(4) The investments referred to in paragraph (3) will require increased funding to United States foreign affairs programs in general, and to priority areas as described in this title in particular.

# SEC. 7102. TERRORIST SANCTUARIES.

(a) FINDINGS.—Consistent with the report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, Congress makes the following findings:

(1) Complex terrorist operations require locations that provide such operations sanctuary from interference by Government or law enforcement personnel.

(2) A terrorist sanctuary existed in Afghanistan before September 11, 2001.

(3) The terrorist sanctuary in Afghanistan provided direct and indirect value to members of al Qaeda who participated in the terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001, and in other terrorist operations.

(4) Terrorist organizations have fled to some of the least governed and most lawless places in the world to find sanctuary.

(5) During the 21st century, terrorists are often focusing on remote regions and failing states as locations to seek sanctuary.

(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS ON UNITED STATES POLICY ON TERRORIST SANCTUARIES.—It is the sense of Congress that it should be the policy of the United States—

(1) to identify foreign countries that are being used as errorist sanctuaries;

(2) to assess current United States resources and tools being used to assist foreign governments to eliminate such sanctuaries;

(3) to develop and implement a coordinated strategy to prevent terrorists from using such foreign countries as sanctuaries; and

(4) to work in bilateral and multilateral fora to elicit the cooperation needed to identify and address terrorist sanctuaries that may exist today, but, so far, remain unknown to governments.

(1) The Government of Pakistan has a critical role to perform in the struggle against terrorism.

(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Congress that the United States should— (1) help to ensure a promising, stable, and secure future for Pakistan over the long term; (2) provide a comprehensive program of assistance to encourage and enable Pakistan— (A) to continue and improve upon its commitment to combating extremists; (B) to seek to resolve any outstanding difficulties with its neighbors and other countries in its region; (C) to continue to make efforts to fully control its territory and borders; (D) to progress toward becoming a more effective and participatory democracy; (E) to participate more vigorously in the global marketplace and to continue to modernize its economy; (F) to take all necessary steps to halt the spread of weapons of mass destruction; (G) to improve and expand access to education for all citizens; and (H) to increase the number and level of exchanges between the Pakistani people and the American people; and (3) continue to provide assistance to Pakistan at not less than the overall levels requested by the President for fiscal year 2005.

(A) The United States and its allies in the international community have made progress in promoting economic and political reform within Afghanistan, including the establishment of a central government with a democratic constitution, a new currency, and a new army, the increase of personal freedom, and the elevation of the standard of living of many Afghans.

(B) A number of significant obstacles must be overcome if Afghanistan is to become a secure and prosperous democracy, and such a transition depends in particular upon—

(i) improving security throughout the country; (ii) disarming and demobilizing militias; (iii) curtailing the rule of the warlords; (iv) promoting equitable economic development; (v) protecting the human rights of the people of Afghanistan; (vi) continuing to hold elections for public officials; and (vii) ending the cultivation, production, and trafficking of narcotics.

with predominantly Muslim populations in order to— (1) increase the number of students in such countries who attend such schools; (2) increase the number of young people who may thereby gain at any early age an appreciation for the culture, society, and history of the United States; and (3) increase the number of young people who may thereby improve their proficiency in the English language.

(c) PILOT PROGRAM.—The Secretary of State, acting through the Director of the Office of Overseas Schools of the Department of State, may conduct a pilot program to make grants to United States-sponsored elementary and secondary schools in countries with predominantly Muslim populations for the purpose of providing full or partial merit-based scholarships to students from lowerincome and middle-income families of such countries to attend such schools.

(d) DETERMINATION OF ELIGIBLE STUDENTS.—For purposes of the pilot program, a United States-sponsored elementary and secondary school that receives a grant under the pilot program may establish criteria to be implemented by such school to determine what constitutes lower-income and middle-income families in the country (or region of the country, if regional variations in income levels in the country are significant) in which such school is located.

(e) RESTRICTION ON USE OF FUNDS.—Amounts appropriated to the Secretary of State pursuant to the authorization of appropriations in subsection (h) shall be used for the sole purpose of making grants under this section, and may not be used for the administration of the Office of Overseas Schools of the Department of State or for any other activity of the Office.

(f) VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION.—Nothing in this section shall be construed to require participation in the pilot program by a United States-sponsored elementary or secondary school in a predominantly Muslim country.

(g) REPORT.—Not later than April 15, 2006, the Secretary of State shall submit to the Committee on International Relations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign

Relations of the Senate a report on the pilot program. The report shall assess the success of the program, examine any obstacles encountered in its implementation, and address whether it should be continued, and if so, provide recommendations to increase its effectiveness.

(h) FUNDING.—There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of State for each of the fiscal years 2005 and 2006, unless otherwise authorized by Congress, such sums as necessary to implement the pilot program under this section.

# SEC. 7114. INTERNATIONAL YOUTH OPPORTUNITY FUND.

(a) FINDINGS.—Consistent with the report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, Congress makes the following findings:

(1) Education that teaches tolerance, the dignity and value of each individual, and respect for different beliefs is a key element in any global strategy to eliminate terrorism.

(2) Education in the Middle East about the world outside at region is weak.

(3) The United Nations has rightly equated literacy with freedom.

(4) The international community is moving toward setting a concrete goal of reducing by half the illiteracy rate in the Middle East by 2010, through the implementation of education programs targeting women and girls and programs for adult literacy, and by other means.

(5) To be effective, efforts to improve education in the Middle East must also include—

(A) support for the provision of basic education tools, such as textbooks that translate more of the world’s knowledge into local languages and local libraries to house such materials; and

(B) more vocational education in trades and business skills.

(6) The Middle East can benefit from some of the same programs to bridge the digital divide that already have been developed for other regions of the world.

(b) INTERNATIONAL YOUTH OPPORTUNITY FUND.—

(1) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Secretary of State is authorized to establish through an existing international organization, such as the United Nations Educational, Science and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) or other similar body, an International Youth Opportunity Fund to provide financial assistance for the improvement of public education in the Middle East and other countries of strategic interest with predominantly Muslim populations.

(2) INTERNATIONAL PARTICIPATION.—The Secretary should seek the cooperation of the international community in establishing and generously supporting the Fund.

# SEC. 7115. THE USE OF ECONOMIC POLICIES TO COMBAT TERRORISM.

(a) FINDINGS.—Consistent with the report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, Congress makes the following findings:

(1) While terrorism is not caused by poverty, breeding grounds for terrorism are created by backward economic policies and repressive political regimes.

(2) Policies that support economic development and reform also have political implications, as economic and political liberties are often linked.

(3) The United States is working toward creating a Middle East Free Trade Area by 2013 and implementing a free trade agreement with Bahrain, and free trade agreements exist between the United States and Israel and the United States and Jordan.

(4) Existing and proposed free trade agreements between the United States and countries with predominantly Muslim populations are drawing interest from other countries in the Middle East region, and countries with predominantly Muslim populations can become full participants in the rules-based global trading system, as the United States considers lowering its barriers to trade.

(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Congress that— (1) a comprehensive United States strategy to counter terrorism should include economic policies that encourage development, open societies, and opportunities for people to improve the lives of their families and to enhance prospects for their children’s future;

(2) one element of such a strategy should encompass the lowering of trade barriers with the poorest countries that have a significant population of Muslim individuals;

(3) another element of such a strategy should encompass United States efforts to promote economic reform in countries that have a significant population of Muslim individuals, including efforts to integrate such countries into the global trading system; and

(4) given the importance of the rule of law in promoting economic development and attracting investment, the United States should devote an increased proportion of its assistance to countries in the Middle East to the promotion of the rule of law.

# SEC. 7116. MIDDLE EAST PARTNERSHIP INITIATIVE.

(a) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.—There are authorized to be appropriated for each of fiscal years 2005 and 2006, (unless otherwise authorized by Congress) such sums as may be necessary for the Middle East Partnership Initiative.

(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Congress that, given the importance of the rule of law and economic reform to development in the Middle East, a significant portion of the funds authorized to be appropriated under subsection (a) should be made available to promote the rule of law in the Middle East.

# SEC. 7117. COMPREHENSIVE COALITION STRATEGY FOR FIGHTINGTERRORISM.

(a) FINDINGS.—Consistent with the report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, Congress makes the following findings:

(1) Almost every aspect of the counterterrorism strategy of the United States relies on international cooperation.

(2) Since September 11, 2001, the number and scope of United States Government contacts with foreign governments concerning counterterrorism have expanded significantly, but such contacts have often been ad hoc and not integrated as a comprehensive and unified approach to counterterrorism.

(b) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of State is authorized in consultation with relevant United States Government agencies, to negotiate on a bilateral or multilateral basis, as appropriate, international agreements under which parties to an agreement work in partnership to address and interdict acts of international terrorism.

(c) INTERNATIONAL CONTACT GROUP ON COUNTERTERRORISM.— (1) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Congress that   
the President— (A) should seek to engage the leaders of the governments of other countries in a process of advancing beyond separate and uncoordinated national counterterrorism strategies to develop with those other governments a comprehensive multilateral strategy to fight terrorism; and (B) to that end, should seek to establish an international counterterrorism policy contact group with the leaders of governments providing leadership in global counterterrorism efforts and governments of countries with sizable Muslim populations, to be used as a ready and flexible international means for discussing and coordinating the development of important counterterrorism policies by the participating governments. (2) AUTHORITY.—The President is authorized to establish   
an international counterterrorism policy contact group with   
the leaders of governments referred to in paragraph (1) for   
the following purposes: (A) To meet annually, or more frequently as the President determines appropriate, to develop in common with such other governments important policies and a strategy that address the various components of international prosecution of the war on terrorism, including policies and a strategy that address military issues, law enforcement, the collection, analysis, and dissemination of intelligence, issues relating to interdiction of travel by terrorists, counterterrorism-related customs issues, financial issues, and issues relating to terrorist sanctuaries.

(B) To address, to the extent (if any) that the President and leaders of other participating governments determine appropriate, long-term issues that can contribute to strengthening stability and security in the Middle East.

# SEC. 7118. FINANCING OF TERRORISM.

(a) FINDINGS.—Consistent with the report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, Congress makes the following findings:

(1) The death or capture of several important financial facilitators has decreased the amount of money available to al Qaeda, and has made it more difficult for al Qaeda to raise and move money.

(2) The capture of al Qaeda financial facilitators has provided a windfall of intelligence that can be used to continue the cycle of disruption.

(3) The United States Government has rightly recognized that information about terrorist money helps in understanding terror networks, searching them out, and disrupting their operations.

(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Congress that—

(1) a critical weapon in the effort to stop terrorist financing should be the targeting of terrorist financial facilitators by intelligence and law enforcement agencies; and

(2) efforts to track terrorist financing must be paramount in United States counterterrorism efforts.

# SEC. 7119. DESIGNATION OF FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, this subtitle shall take effect on the date of enactment of this Act.

# Subtitle B—Terrorist Travel and Effective Screening

# SEC. 7201. COUNTERTERRORIST TRAVEL INTELLIGENCE.

(a) FINDINGS.—Consistent with the report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, Congress makes the following findings:

(1) Travel documents are as important to terrorists as weapons since terrorists must travel clandestinely to meet, train, plan, case targets, and gain access to attack sites.

(2) International travel is dangerous for terrorists because they must surface to pass through regulated channels, present themselves to border security officials, or attempt to circumvent inspection points.

(3) Terrorists use evasive, but detectable, methods to travel, such as altered and counterfeit passports and visas, specific travel methods and routes, liaisons with corrupt government officials, human smuggling networks, supportive travel agencies, and immigration and identity fraud.

(4) Before September 11, 2001, no Federal agency systematically analyzed terrorist travel strategies. If an agency had done so, the agency could have discovered the ways in which the terrorist predecessors to al Qaeda had been systematically, but detectably, exploiting weaknesses in our border security since the early 1990s.

(5) Many of the hijackers were potentially vulnerable to interception by border authorities. Analyzing their characteristic travel documents and travel patterns could have allowed authorities to intercept some of the hijackers and a more effective use of information available in government databases could have identified some of the hijackers.

(6) The routine operations of our immigration laws and the aspects of those laws not specifically aimed at protecting against terrorism inevitably shaped al Qaeda’s planning and opportunities.

(7) New insights into terrorist travel gained since September 11, 2001, have not been adequately integrated into the front lines of border security.

(8) The small classified terrorist travel intelligence collection and analysis program currently in place has produced useful results and should be expanded.

# (b) STRATEGY.—

(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the Director of the National Counterterrorism Center shall submit to Congress unclassified and classified versions of a strategy for combining terrorist travel intelligence, operations, and law enforcement into a cohesive effort to intercept terrorists, find terrorist travel facilitators, and constrain terrorist mobility domestically and internationally. The report to Congress should include a description of the actions taken to implement the strategy and an assessment regarding vulnerabilities within the United States and foreign travel systems that may be exploited by international terrorists, human smugglers and traffickers, and their facilitators.

(2) COORDINATION.—The strategy shall be developed in coordination with all relevant Federal agencies.

(3) CONTENTS.—The strategy may address—

(A) a program for collecting, analyzing, disseminating, and utilizing information and intelligence regarding terrorist travel tactics and methods, and outline which Federal intelligence, diplomatic, and law enforcement agencies will be held accountable for implementing each element of the strategy;

(I) the use of foreign and technical assistance to advance border security measures and law enforcement operations against terrorist travel facilitators;

(J) the feasibility of developing a program to provide each consular, port of entry, and immigration benefits office with a counterterrorist travel expert trained and authorized to use the relevant authentication technologies and cleared to access all appropriate immigration, law enforcement, and intelligence databases;

(K) the feasibility of digitally transmitting suspect passport information to a central cadre of specialists, either as an interim measure until such time as experts described under subparagraph (J) are available at consular, port of entry, and immigration benefits offices, or otherwise;

(L) the development of a mechanism to ensure the coordination and dissemination of terrorist travel intelligence and operational information among the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State, the National Counterterrorism Center, and other appropriate agencies;

(M) granting consular officers and immigration adjudicators, as appropriate, the security clearances necessary to access law enforcement sensitive and intelligence databases; and

# SEC. 7204. INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS TO TRACK AND CURTAIL TERRORIST TRAVEL THROUGH THE USE OF FRAUDULENTLY OBTAINED DOCUMENTS.

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following findings: (1) International terrorists travel across international bor  
ders to raise funds, recruit members, train for operations,   
escape capture, communicate, and plan and carry out attacks. (2) The international terrorists who planned and carried   
out the attack on the World Trade Center on February 26,

1993, the attack on the embassies of the United States in Kenya and Tanzania on August 7, 1998, the attack on the USS Cole on October 12, 2000, and the attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, traveled across international borders to plan and carry out these attacks.

(3) The international terrorists who planned other attacks on the United States, including the plot to bomb New York City landmarks in 1993, the plot to bomb the New York City subway in 1997, and the millennium plot to bomb Los Angeles International Airport on December 31, 1999, traveled across international borders to plan and carry out these attacks.

(4) Many of the international terrorists who planned and carried out large-scale attacks against foreign targets, including the attack in Bali, Indonesia, on October 11, 2002, and the attack in Madrid, Spain, on March 11, 2004, traveled across international borders to plan and carry out these attacks.

(5) Throughout the 1990s, international terrorists, including those involved in the attack on the World Trade Center on February 26, 1993, the plot to bomb New York City landmarks in 1993, and the millennium plot to bomb Los Angeles International Airport on December 31, 1999, traveled on fraudulent passports and often had more than 1 passport.

(6) Two of the September 11, 2001, hijackers were carrying passports that had been manipulated in a fraudulent manner.

(7) The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, (commonly referred to as the 9/11 Commission), stated that ‘‘Targeting travel is at least as powerful a weapon against terrorists as targeting their money.’’.

(b) INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS TO TRACK AND CURTAIL TERRORIST TRAVEL.—

(1) INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT ON LOST, STOLEN, OR FALSIFIED DOCUMENTS.—The President should lead efforts to track and curtail the travel of terrorists by supporting the drafting, adoption, and implementation of international agreements, and relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions to track and stop international travel by terrorists and other criminals through the use of lost, stolen, or falsified documents to augment United Nations and other international anti-terrorism efforts.

(2) CONTENTS OF INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT.—The President should seek, as appropriate, the adoption or full implementation of effective international measures to—

(A) share information on lost, stolen, and fraudulent passports and other travel documents for the purposes of preventing the undetected travel of persons using such passports and other travel documents that were obtained improperly;

(B) establish and implement a real-time verification system of passports and other travel documents with issuing authorities;

(C) share with officials at ports of entry in any such country information relating to lost, stolen, and fraudulent passports and other travel documents;

(D) encourage countries— (i) to criminalize—

(I) the falsification or counterfeiting of travel documents or breeder documents for any purpose; (II) the use or attempted use of false documents to obtain a visa or cross a border for any purpose; (III) the possession of tools or implements used to falsify or counterfeit such documents; (IV) the trafficking in false or stolen travel documents and breeder documents for any purpose; (V) the facilitation of travel by a terrorist; and (VI) attempts to commit, including conspiracies to commit, the crimes specified in subclauses (I) through (V); (ii) to impose significant penalties to appropriately punish violations and effectively deter the crimes specified in clause (i); and (iii) to limit the issuance of citizenship papers, passports, identification documents, and similar documents to persons— (I) whose identity is proven to the issuing authority; (II) who have a bona fide entitlement to or need for such documents; and (III) who are not issued such documents principally on account of a disproportional payment made by them or on their behalf to the issuing authority; (E) provide technical assistance to countries to help them fully implement such measures; and (F) permit immigration and border officials— (i) to confiscate a lost, stolen, or falsified passport at ports of entry; (ii) to permit the traveler to return to the sending country without being in possession of the lost, stolen, or falsified passport; and (iii) to detain and investigate such traveler upon the return of the traveler to the sending country.

# SEC. 7205. INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS FOR TRANSLITERATION OF NAMES INTO THE ROMAN ALPHABET FOR INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL DOCUMENTS AND NAME-BASED WATCHLIST SYSTEMS.

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following findings:

(1) The current lack of a single convention for translating Arabic names enabled some of the 19 hijackers of aircraft used in the terrorist attacks against the United States that occurred on September 11, 2001, to vary the spelling of their names to defeat name-based terrorist watchlist systems and to make more difficult any potential efforts to locate them.

(2) Although the development and utilization of terrorist watchlist systems using biometric identifiers will be helpful, the full development and utilization of such systems will take several years, and name-based terrorist watchlist systems will always be useful.

(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Congress that the President should seek to enter into an international agreement to modernize and improve standards for the transliteration of names into the Roman alphabet in order to ensure 1 common spelling for such names for international travel documents and name-based watchlist systems.

# SEC. 7206. IMMIGRATION SECURITY INITIATIVE.

# Subtitle C—National Preparedness

# SEC. 7301. THE INCIDENT COMMAND SYSTEM.

(a) FINDINGS.—Consistent with the report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, Congress makes the following findings:

(1) The attacks on September 11, 2001, demonstrated that even the most robust emergency response capabilities can be overwhelmed if an attack is large enough.

(2) Teamwork, collaboration, and cooperation at an incident site are critical to a successful response to a terrorist attack.

(3) Key decisionmakers who are represented at the incident command level help to ensure an effective response, the efficient use of resources, and responder safety.

(4) The incident command system also enables emergency managers and first responders to manage, generate, receive, evaluate, share, and use information.

(5) Regular joint training at all levels is essential to ensuring close coordination during an actual incident.

(6) In Homeland Security Presidential Directive 5, the President directed the Secretary of Homeland Security to develop an incident command system, to be known as the National Incident Management System (NIMS), and directed all Federal agencies to make the adoption of NIMS a condition for the receipt of Federal emergency preparedness assistance by States, territories, tribes, and local governments beginning in fiscal year 2005.

(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Congress that— (1) the United States needs to implement the recommendations of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States by adopting a unified incident command system and significantly enhancing communications connectivity between and among all levels of government agencies, emergency response providers (as defined in section 2 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 101), and other organizations with emergency response capabilities;

(2) the unified incident command system should enable emergency managers and first responders to manage, generate, receive, evaluate, share, and use information in the event of a terrorist attack or a significant national disaster;

(3) emergency response agencies nationwide should adopt the Incident Command System known as NIMS;

(4) when multiple agencies or multiple jurisdictions are involved, they should follow a unified command system based on NIMS;

(5) the regular use of, and training in, NIMS by States and, to the extent practicable, territories, tribes, and local governments, should be a condition for receiving Federal preparedness assistance; and

(6) the Secretary of Homeland Security should require, as a further condition of receiving homeland security preparedness funds from the Office of State and Local Government Coordination and Preparedness, that grant applicants document measures taken to fully and aggressively implement the Incident Command System and unified command procedures.

# EC. 7408. USE OF COUNTERNARCOTICS ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIE IN CERTAIN EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE APPRAISALS.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Subtitle E of title VIII of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 411 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:

# ‘‘SEC. 843. USE OF COUNTERNARCOTICS ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES IN CERTAIN EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE APPRAISALS.

‘‘(a) IN GENERAL.—Each subdivision of the Department that is a National Drug Control Program Agency shall include as one of the criteria in its performance appraisal system, for each employee directly or indirectly involved in the enforcement of Federal, State, or local narcotics laws, the performance of that employee with respect to the enforcement of Federal, State, or local narcotics laws, relying to the greatest extent practicable on objective performance measures, including—

‘‘(2) the degree to which that employee cooperated with or contributed to the efforts of other employees, either within the Department or other Federal, State, or local agencies, in counternarcotics enforcement.

‘‘(b) DEFINITIONS.—For purposes of this section— ‘‘(1) the term ‘National Drug Control Program Agency’ means— ‘‘(A) a National Drug Control Program Agency, as defined in section 702(7) of the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998 (as last in effect); and ‘‘(B) any subdivision of the Department that has a significant counternarcotics responsibility, as determined by— ‘‘(i) the counternarcotics officer, appointed under section 878; or ‘‘(ii) if applicable, the counternarcotics officer’s successor in function (as determined by the Secretary); and ‘‘(2) the term ‘performance appraisal system’ means a system under which periodic appraisals of job performance of employees are made, whether under chapter 43 of title 5, United States Code, or otherwise.’’. (b) CLERICAL AMENDMENT.—The table of contents for the Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended by inserting after the item relating to section 842 the following:

# Subtitle E—Public Safety Spectrum

# SEC. 7501. DIGITAL TELEVISION CONVERSION DEADLINE.

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: (1) Congress granted television broadcasters additional 6 megahertz blocks of spectrum to transmit digital broadcasts simultaneously with the analog broadcasts they submit on their original 6 megahertz blocks of spectrum.

(2) Section 309(j)(14) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 309(j)(14)) requires each television broadcaster to cease analog transmissions and return 6 megahertz of spectrum not later than—

(A) December 31, 2006; or

(B) the date on which more than 85 percent of the television households in the market of such broadcaster can view digital broadcast television channels using a digital television, a digital-to-analog converter box, cable service, or satellite service.

(3) Twenty-four megahertz of spectrum occupied by television broadcasters has been earmarked for use by first responders as soon as the television broadcasters return the spectrum broadcasters being used to provide analog transmissions. This spectrum would be ideal to provide first responders with interoperable communications channels.

(4) Large parts of the vacated spectrum could be auctioned for advanced commercial services, such as wireless broadband. (5) The 85 percent penetration test described in paragraph (2)(B) could delay the termination of analog television broadcasts and the return of spectrum well beyond 2007, hindering the use of that spectrum for these important public safety and advanced commercial uses.

(6) While proposals to require broadcasters to return, on a date certain, the spectrum earmarked for future public safety use may improve the ability of public safety entities to begin planning for use of this spectrum, such proposals have certain deficiencies. The proposals would require the dislocation of up to 75 broadcast stations, which also serve a critical public safety function by broadcasting weather, traffic, disaster, and other safety alerts. Such disparate treatment of broadcasters would be unfair to the broadcasters and their respective viewers. Requiring the return of all analog broadcast spectrum by a date certain would have the benefit of addressing the digital television transition in a comprehensive fashion that treats all broadcasters and viewers equally, while freeing spectrum for advanced commercial services.

(7) The Federal Communications Commission should consider all regulatory means available to expedite the return of the analog spectrum. (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Congress that— (1) Congress must act to pass legislation in the first session of the 109th Congress that establishes a comprehensive approach to the timely return of analog broadcast spectrum as early as December 31, 2006; and (2) any delay in the adoption of the legislation described in paragraph (1) will delay the ability of public safety entities to begin planning to use this needed spectrum.

# SEC. 7502. STUDIES ON TELECOMMUNICATIONS CAPABILITIES AND REQUIREMENTS.

(a) ALLOCATIONS OF SPECTRUM FOR EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROVIDERS.—The Federal Communications Commission shall, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, conduct a study to assess short-term and long-term needs for allocations of additional portions of the electromagnetic spectrum for Federal, State, and local emergency response providers, including whether or not an additional allocation of spectrum in the 700 megahertz band should be granted by Congress to such emergency response providers.

(b) STRATEGIES TO MEET PUBLIC SAFETY TELECOMMUNICATIONS REQUIREMENTS.—The Secretary of Homeland Security shall, in consultation with the Federal Communications Commission and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, conduct a study to assess strategies that may be used to meet public safety telecommunications needs, including—

(1) the need and efficacy of deploying nationwide interoperable communications networks (including the potential technical and operational standards and protocols for nationwide interoperable broadband mobile communications networks that may be used by Federal, State, regional, and local governmental and nongovernmental public safety, homeland security, and other emergency response personnel);

(2) the capacity of public safety entities to utilize wireless broadband applications; and

(3) the communications capabilities of all emergency response providers, including hospitals and health care workers, and current efforts to promote communications coordination and training among emergency response providers.

(c) STUDY REQUIREMENTS.—In conducting the studies required by subsections (a) and (b), the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Federal Communications Commission shall—

(1) seek input from Federal, State, local, and regional emergency response providers regarding the operation and administration of a potential nationwide interoperable broadband mobile communications network; and

(2) consider the use of commercial wireless technologies to the greatest extent practicable.

(3) COMPLETION DATE.—Necessary background investigations and eligibility determinations to permit appropriate prospective transition team members to have access to classified information shall be completed, to the fullest extent practicable, by the day after the date of the general election.

(d) EFFECTIVE DATE.—Notwithstanding section 351, this section and the amendments made by this section shall take effect on the date of enactment of this Act.

# Subtitle G—Improving International Standards and Cooperation to Fight Terrorist Financing

SEC. 7701. IMPROVING INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS AND COOPERA-TION TO FIGHT TERRORIST FINANCING.

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following findings:

(1) The global war on terrorism and cutting off terrorist financing is a policy priority for the United States and its partners, working bilaterally and multilaterally through the United Nations, the United Nations Security Council and its committees, such as the 1267 and 1373 Committees, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), and various international financial institutions, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), and the regional multilateral development banks, and other multilateral fora.

(2) The international financial community has become engaged in the global fight against terrorist financing. The Financial Action Task Force has focused on the new threat posed by terrorist financing to the international financial system, resulting in the establishment of the FATF’s Eight Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing as the international standard on combating terrorist financing. The Group of Seven and the Group of Twenty Finance Ministers are developing action plans to curb the financing of terror. In addition, other economic and regional fora, such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Forum, and the Western Hemisphere Financial Ministers, have been used to marshal political will and actions in support of combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) standards.

(3) FATF’s Forty Recommendations on Money Laundering and the Eight Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing are the recognized global standards for fighting money laundering and terrorist financing. The FATF has engaged in an assessment process for jurisdictions based on their compliance with these standards.

(4) In March 2004, the IMF and IBRD Boards agreed to make permanent a pilot program of collaboration with the FATF to assess global compliance with the FATF Forty Recommendations on Money Laundering and the Eight Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing. As a result, antimoney laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) assessments are now a regular part of their Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) and Offshore Financial Center assessments, which provide for a comprehensive analysis of the strength of a jurisdiction’s financial system. These reviews assess potential systemic vulnerabilities, consider sectoral development needs and priorities, and review the state of implementation of and compliance with key financial codes and regulatory standards, among them the AML and CFT standards.

(5) To date, 70 FSAPs have been conducted, with over 24 of those incorporating AML and CFT assessments. The international financial institutions (IFIs), the FATF, and the FATF-style regional bodies together are expected to assess AML and CFT regimes in up to 40 countries or jurisdictions per year. This will help countries and jurisdictions identify deficiencies in their AML and CFT regimes and help focus technical assistance efforts.

(6) Technical assistance programs from the United States and other nations, coordinated with the Department of State and other departments and agencies, are playing an important role in helping countries and jurisdictions address shortcomings in their AML and CFT regimes and bringing their regimes into conformity with international standards. Training is coordinated within the United States Government, which leverages multilateral organizations and bodies and international financial institutions to internationalize the conveyance of technical assistance.

(7) In fulfilling its duties in advancing incorporation of AML and CFT standards into the IFIs as part of the IFIs’ work on protecting the integrity of the international monetary system, the Department of the Treasury, under the guidance of the Secretary of the Treasury, has effectively brought together all of the key United States Government agencies. In particular, United States Government agencies continue to work together to foster broad support for this important undertaking in various multilateral fora, and United States Government agencies recognize the need for close coordination and communication within our own Government.

(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING SUCCESS IN MULTILATERAL ORGANIZATIONS.—It is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of the Treasury should continue to promote the dissemination of international AML and CFT standards, and to press for full implementation of the FATF $4 0 + 8$ Recommendations by all countries in order to curb financial risks and hinder terrorist financing around the globe. The efforts of the Secretary in this regard should include, where necessary or appropriate, multilateral action against countries whose counter-money laundering regimes and efforts against the financing of terrorism fall below recognized international standards.
