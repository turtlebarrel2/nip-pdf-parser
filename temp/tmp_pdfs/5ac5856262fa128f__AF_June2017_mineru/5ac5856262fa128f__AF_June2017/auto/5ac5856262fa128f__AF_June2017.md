# Stretch Mobility

April 13, 2017

his spring, Air Mobility Command’s tankers and airlifters were busy supplying everything from beans to bullets, moving passengers and patients, and supplying fuel to aircraft flying combat missions worldwide. This is no surprise. Mobility has been in surge mode since at least 1990.

Wartime operations atop nonstop steady-state requirements will grind down the force if there are not enough pilots, maintainers, healthy airframes, or training opportunities to keep up the pace. This is the bind AMC finds itself in today.

The command’s expeditionary airmen are deployed to 77 locations around the world—building and sustaining airfields, supporting flying operations, and assisting local governments and suffering populations. Some of the 23 nations AMC’s expeditionary airmen have recently operated in include Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria.

A remote airfield in northern Syria was built up from just a flat spot on the ground late last year. By the end of February, it had already hosted more than 150 C-17 and C-130 missions, according to US Air Forces Central Command (AFCENT).

These mobility flights provide US special operations forces and allied Syrian rebels the supplies and ammunition needed for attacks on ISIS strongholds deep inside Syria, AFCENT Deputy Commander Maj. Gen. Jay B. Silveria said at AFA’s Air Warfare Symposium in March. Without this base it would be “much more difficult to get [supplies] into Syria,” Silveria noted.

Overhead, AMC tankers are flying more than 40 percent of the sorties in the war against ISIS. They allow the Air Force, other military services, and international aircraft to survey the battlefield and press their attacks. Many of the same KC-135s that once flew over Vietnam now refuel coalition aircraft (one every five minutes) over the Middle East.

Meanwhile, a hemisphere away, AMC crews quickly responded to deadly flooding and landslides in Peru that killed more than 100 and left 150,000 people homeless. In April, two C-130Js and 25 airmen from Little Rock AFB, Ark., delivered urgently needed relief supplies to the devastated area.

![](images/a64b498156ca6674d41910e4ee680db0e4cf255bce9cd4c6ddc904f846a393dc.jpg)  
1956: The year this Chevy and the KC-135 were born.

In the aggregate, an AMC aircraft takes off for a mission once every 2.8 minutes, around the clock, every day. The command does this with far fewer airmen than it had in 1990, 2001, or even 2011—with an aircraft inventory that is getting ever smaller and older.

USAF is “too small for what the nation expects of it,” Air Force Secretary nominee Heather A. Wilson told lawmakers at her confirmation hearing in March. “I think we sometimes take for granted American dominance in air and space power.”

The nation should not take anything for granted when the airmen operating and supporting today’s KC-135 and KC-10 tankers typically perform their missions in aircraft older than they are. The Stratotanker’s first flight was in 1956 and the fleet averages 55 years old.

# Excessive demand grinds away at USAF’s mobility force.

Even the KC-10 Extender, the “new” tanker, is now 31 years old.

This fleet is being run ragged and is only sustained through careful planning and airmen’s perseverance and sweat.

“Between Fiscal Year 2012 and Fiscal Year 2016, AMC’s tanker fleet—the KC-135s and KC-10s—overflew their program flying hours by 237 percent and 178 percent, respectively,” said Gen. Carlton D. Everhart II, AMC commander, in an April meeting with defense reporters.

In other words, for four straight years, USAF’s tankers flew about twice as many hours as expected. “The demand on Air Mobility Command is excessive,” Everhart stated, “and I don’t see that stopping.”

The question is: How long can USAF keep this up? Hopefully for a long time, because under current plans those geriatric KC-135s will, shockingly, be nearly 100 years old before the last of them is replaced under a three-phase modernization program.

Phase one, the nascent KC-46 program, will deliver 179 aircraft. That acquisition then needs to be followed by two additional tanker recapitalization programs.

The notion of airmen someday flying century-old tankers into war would be comical if it were not so frightening, but this will have to be addressed in stages. First things first: The Air Force and Boeing need to quickly work out the kinks in the KC-46 program, get deliveries up to speed, and hopefully accelerate or increase purchases in the future.

No other nation has air mobility comparable to the United States. Allies have “always relied on us, and they’ll continue to rely on us,” Everhart said.

Mobility capability allows America to be a global leader— able to deliver aid or lead a fight, anywhere on Earth, on short notice. Don’t take that for granted. ✪

# Selfridge Selflessness

I certainly enjoyed Wilson Brissett’s fine article commemorating the 100th anniversary of the Selfridge Air National Guard Base [“A Century of Action,” March, p. 46].

The outstanding record of the host unit, the 127th Wing, is certainly commendable. I am, however, compelled to question the accuracy of: “The sixmonth stretch was the longest mass deployment of Selfridge airmen since the Korean War,” attributed to wing officials, and describing the wing’s 2015 deployment in support of Operation Inherent Resolve.

In October 1990, the Selfridgebased 927th (then Tactical Airlift Group) deployed eight C-130E aircraft along with several hundred airmen in support of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. The 927th joined its sister 914th TAG with eight additional aircraft and airmen from Niagara Falls, N.Y., to form the 1650th TAW Provisional at Sharjah Airport in the UAE. The deployed base was affectionately named Mirage.

As of February of 1991, the 1650th had flown 10,000 sorties moving 15,000 passengers and 12,000 tons of cargo. Five thousand hours were flown over 3,200 sorties during 42 days of combat coded action.

Just before the initiation of Desert Storm, the tactics officers from the

various deployed C-130 units met to plan the air logistics phase of the “left hook” redeployment of ground forces.

Over 100 C-130s flew nonstop for three days to complete the critical strategic move to the west. If my memory serves correctly, not a single missed sortie assignment was recorded during the entire six-month deployment of the combined 927th and 914th. The 1650th was reported to be the only AFRES support flying unit deployed to Desert Storm.

# Nukes Not for Everyone

I thoroughly enjoyed the feature article “Rebuilding the Missile Force” by Senior Editor Wilson Brissett in the February 2017 issue [p. 20].

I wrote a letter to the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Air Force in 2014, based on newspaper [Associated Press] articles; TV shows; interviews with missile crew members on their concerns about missile duty [and the] firing of colonels at the operational wings, in the Air Force Times; and my operational ICBM experience starting in the 1960s.

As some background, I was commissioned in 1962 and was a procurement officer for the first 18 months. Then in 1963 and ’64, the Air Force pulled most of the support officers into the missile field to fill slots for Minuteman, Atlas, and Titan missile crew commander positions. You had to be at least a first lieutenant as a deputy commander, and commanders were senior captains or junior majors (many of whom were on flying status). We were a very important part of the Strategic Air Command (SAC), one of the premier, if not the best, major commands to be in. All of us considered these crew commander positions very important and excellent opportunities for promotion. The flying status officers transferred into SAC from other major commands for the promotion potential.

We were posturing the Minuteman I wing at F. E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming, and I was deputy missile crew commander for over a year. During that time, my first crew commander, in training, was a senior captain (pilot) whom I turned in as not being stable to be in charge of nuclear weapons. This was under the Air Force Human Reliability Program, I think AFR 35-99, maybe now called the Personnel Reliability Program. This was with great risk to me, turning this senior captain into my lieutenant colonel squadron operations officer. Subsequently, he was relieved of his duties and left the Air Force. This point is extremely important. Not all officers are suited to be in charge of nuclear weapons.

I wrote a letter to DOD/AF officials because the Defense Department has, for whatever reasons, degraded the importance of the Air Force ICBM mission as a critical part of our nuclear deterrence strategy. When the Air Force reorganized and SAC was replaced by Space Command and then by Global Strike Command and defused further by Air Combat Command, the premier status of the nuclear strike force crumbled. Instead of seeking and getting the best and brightest officers with extremely high promotion potential, the Air Force demonstrated a lack of importance of the ICBM force, and consequently, problems followed. I do not believe it is only a money issue. It is a perceived nonchallenging assignment with minimal support of the Air Force leadership and with minimal rewards. Why are the academy officers so concerned about getting a missile crew assignment? I do not believe that the two general officer pilots, who were never missile crew commanders, should have been selected to head the investigation of the problems of the ICBM force.

More opportunities, challenging assignments, and promotions are needed for the MM III operational force. There should be a variety of career paths that allow this critical operational force to advance and experience challenging Air Force careers. In your article, there appears to be more career opportunities and wing-wide assignments with effective senior leadership in the 13N career field, which is good. However, there should be an expansion as follows: The junior officers should see multiple paths, while going in and out of the operational MM III positions. This could include related assignments at the MM III Program Office (various acquisition positions), the national targeting organization, depot assignments using their operational experience, operational test launch positions to include more live launches, RV acquisition and depot assignments, and related developmental work at the labs and industry. This is in addition to headquarters and Defense Department positions. This will allow a wide wealth of experience and will ultimately allow advancement into senior level missile operational positions.

# The Right Stuff

As a cover-to-cover reader of your magazine, usually on the day it reaches my mailbox, and also having been a schoolboy who followed every detail on Project Mercury, it was very gratifying to see the great tribute to John Glenn in the current issue [“Air Force World: John H. Glenn, 1921-2016,” March, p. 22].

I would, however, like to point out a technical error, which seems to be in most of the recent discussions of his mission. In point of fact, the MA-6 mission was not reduced in duration but was scheduled as a three-orbit mission, as was the following MA-7 “proving” mission flown by Scott Carpenter three months later. The confusion has arisen apparently from the radio transmission to Glenn when he reached orbit that his trajectory was “good for at least seven orbits.” That meant only that the Atlas booster had inserted Friendship 7 into the planned orbit.

As described by the legendary flight controller Gene Kranz in his classic book of 17 years ago, Failure Is Not an Option, the mission plan was to have a trajectory good enough for additional orbits in the event it was desired to keep him up longer for some reason. The faulty indication that the heat shield had come loose did create much concern and a change in mission sequence in order to leave the retrorocket package on throughout re-entry, and that with consequent concern for damage to the shield, but it did not cause the mission to be cut short.

Details aside, thanks for all the great articles, especially the tribute to Colonel Glenn.

# Out of Their Depth

John Correll’s excellent article gave an in-depth account of the British aerial torpedo attack on the Italian battleships in Taranto Harbor [“The Air Raid at Taranto,” March, p. 60]. This attack occurred more than a year before the Japanese raid on Pearl Harbor. Yet it did not lead to actions that could have protected the American fleet.

Mr. Correll reports that Taranto Harbor was 40 feet deep, about the same depth as Pearl Harbor. He also states that when Admiral Ingersoll sent a warning about Taranto to Pearl Harbor, the admiral erroneously listed the depth of the water where torpedoes were dropped at Taranto. He said that they were much deeper—between 84 to 90 feet, with a few runs at 66- to 72-foot depths. This difference in stated depths between Taranto and Pearl Harbor may have caused Admiral Kimmel to not consider the memo relevant to his situation.

Certainly, nearly every source on the Taranto Raid lists its depth as being about 40 feet, and that would make Ingersoll’s memo incorrect. The book on Taranto by Lowry and Wellham is particularly noteworthy because Wellham was one of the pilots in the attack. On p. 68 of the 2000 paperback edition, the book states that Mare Grande is about 45 feet deep.

However, we may need to rethink this depth. Actual hydrographic studies of Taranto Harbor paint a very different picture of Mare Grande. Several have been done, and they agree that Mare Grande is a fairly deep harbor, citing depths of over 100 feet in many locations. Based on the after-action report by Captain Boyd of the HMS Illustrious, all torpedoes were dropped in and all battleships were moored [in depths ranging from 64 to 93 feet]. Based on hydrographic information, then, it appears that we should seriously question the statement that the British Taranto raid took place at Pearl Harbor depths. Where Ingersoll came up with his depth information is unknown, but it appears that he was actually correct.

If Ingersoll’s correct statement of drop depths at Taranto deterred Kimmel from considering the memo as being relevant to Pearl Harbor, that was unfortunately because Taranto was only part of the British aerial torpedo story. As Mr. Correll notes, the British had earlier dropped their torpedoes successfully in water as shallow as 22 feet. That would certainly have gotten Kimmel’s attention.

Ray Panko Honolulu

The numerous operational accounts that I have seen on the Taranto attack report an average depth in the outer harbor of between 39 and 49 feet.

The after-action report Mr. Panko cites from Capt. D. W. Boyd, commander of Illustrious, includes information on range and altitude of the attacks but does not mention harbor depth. The approximate point at which the torpedoes struck the water could be estimated from the range and the general direction of approach.

Two of the battleships struck by the torpedoes were left with their decks awash but not completely submerged. Conte di Cavour, with a 40-foot hole in the hull, settled on the bottom with its superstructure above water. This is at odds with the assumption of greater depth. The Italians managed to beach a third battleship to keep it from sinking.

The gist of the advisory from US Rear Adm. Royal E. Ingersoll, assistant Chief of Naval Operations, in June 1941, was to state the threat level warning for aerial torpedoes at 75 feet or deeper. The quality of his assessment was seen six months later when Japanese torpedo bombers attacked the US fleet in 40 feet of water at Pearl Harbor.—John T. Correll

# Getting Modern

I enjoyed retired Colonel Meilinger’s article, “Learning the Not-So-Obvious Lessons,” in the March 2017 issue [p. 68], but think that he and the Air Force are both failing to learn an extremely important, but which seems to be the not-so-obvious, lesson about what developments in technology are making possible regarding service roles. Thanks to advances in Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) surveillance and moving target precision attack technologies that make it possible to locate and then destroy an enemy army’s vehicles when they are moving deep in enemy territory, US Air Force airpower now has the potential to duplicate the change in roles that naval forces achieved during World War II.

Before Pearl Harbor, the US Navy’s leaders expected that their naval aviation forces would be employed in support of their surface forces, with close combat battleship gunfire being their primary means of defeating the Japanese Navy. However, instead of just locating the opposing fleet, naval aviation proved to be able to defeat that fleet before it could move into gunfire range of our ships. But this change in roles between air and surface forces was not possible on land at that time because of the great difficulties airmen experienced in locating and then hitting an enemy army’s vehicles, especially when they moved at night or during bad weather. As a result, it was necessary to employ airpower in support of our army by attempting to delay the movement of enemy vehicles through the targeting of fixed transportation infrastructure, like bridges and tunnels, and then providing close air support when the two armies had moved into close proximity to each other.

But during Desert Storm, advances in technology revealed the potential to change roles was possible because now we could detect and hit an enemy army’s vehicles, even when they moved at night, well before they could get into close proximity to our land forces. During the Battle of Khafji, which someday historians will see as the land warfare equivalent of the Battle of the Coral Sea in World War II, Iraqi army vehicles attempting to use the cover of darkness to achieve a surprise attack were detected, located, and targeted by a prototype Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) long before most of these vehicles could move into close proximity to coalition land forces.

The immense importance of being able to detect, locate, and precisely target an opposing army’s vehicles when they are moving results from the fact that movement is how armies achieve the advantages of surprise, favorable position, and superior mass. Moreover, in addition to their mobility, modern armies depend on their vehicles for armored protection, heavy firepower, supplies, and engineering support. By targeting these vehicles when they are moving, the US gains a number of important advantages. Attacks will not be wasted on decoys or previously destroyed vehicles. Since they will be occupied by enemy soldiers, lethal precision air attacks can create such fear that enemy soldiers will become unwilling to risk occupying a moving vehicle, making it possible to achieve widespread paralysis faster and with far fewer attacks than could be achieved solely by attrition. (We have already seen the value of using fear of precision HARM air attacks to suppress surface-to-air missile sites.) Yet another advantage of creating paralysis by targeting moving vehicles is the ability to measure effectiveness in real time.

Once widespread paralysis is achieved, friendly land forces will possess the dominant maneuver needed to complete the enemy’s defeat with relatively little risk. But before this occurs, friendly land forces should be employed in support of our airpower by using their maneuver to put the enemy commander on the horns of a dilemma that has no satisfactory answer. The dilemma is this: If the enemy attempts to counter our Army’s maneuver by moving, he makes his vehicles vulnerable to being seen and destroyed by precision air attacks, but if he attempts to reduce the risks from air attacks by dispersing and not moving, he will be unable to counter our Army’s maneuver while providing even more time for his forces to be located and destroyed by air attacks. Unfortunately, this same issue of Air Force Magazine [“Air Force World: Moving Forward with JSTARS Recap, p. 19] states that the Air Force plans to limit the JSTARS recap fleet to only 17 aircraft, indicating that this not-soobvious lesson regarding the potential of exploiting GMTI surveillance and targeting to reverse Air Force and Army roles has yet to be learned.

Forces,” purported establishing a permanent Air Force presence in the Middle East by moving two wings of the retiring B-52Ds to Southwest Asia,rather than sending them to the USAF “Bone Yard.” Half of the aircraft would remain flyable and the other half could be used for cannibalization. Unfortunately, the timing was not good for such a plan. The B-1s were nearing readiness, and funding and maintaining a maintenance-demanding, vintage 1950 aircraft did not appear to meet serious headquarters consideration.

Hindsight is always nice, but what if USAF would have made such a move in the early or mid-80s? Would the presence of a full-time military force using even an old, but viable, weapon system have changed the environment of the Middle East during this period?

It is interesting that 35 years later, B-52Hs, not B-52Ds, are performing the same function for US Central Command that was envisioned in the paper.

# They Ain’t Perks

# A Modest Proposal

I enjoyed Mr. Everstine’s article, “Continuous Sandbox Presence,” in the April/May edition of your magazine [p. 30]. However, the employment of a permanent bomber presence in the Middle East was proposed many years ago.

In the January 2017 issue of Air Force Magazine, Megan Scully’s article, “Retention Questions,” touched on a variety of challenges our Air Force and DOD as a whole face, some of them repeats from various decades. On p. 49, Ms. Scully describes the comparison of military service to civilian service as “apples to oranges,” which is a very key observation. However, she describes recent policies that the military has implemented as “perks that go along with military service” to improve retention. Ms. Scully should have used the term “readiness” rather than “perks” because that is what those policies support. As a squadron commander I had to look a female senior airman, who was a single parent, in the eye and order this professional to deploy to Southwest Asia for four months, so I don’t view this policy in military service as a “perk.” Also on p. 49, Ms. Scully states the “biggest challenge is convincing those airmen with six to 16 years”—again, the term “convincing” is misleading. The vast majority of airmen patriotically volunteered to be a member of the greatest Air Force in the world. There comes a point in an airman’s career to weigh the facts when deciding it’s time to separate from military service. Some of those key facts are family needs, medical issues, separation from the family, and pure deployment “burnout.” So, there is no “convincing,” but readiness

In 1981-82, I was fortunate enough to be selected as a USAF research associate (RA) and spent the year at the Mershon Center, Ohio State University. One of the requirements as an RA was to prepare and present a scholarly paper for the Air Staff. My paper, “Chain of Thunder: B-52D Firepower for America’s Conventional

opportunities, to consider. The funding expended on bonuses to pilots and now remotely piloted aircraft operators will continue to be a challenge in meeting retention goals for these career fields.

Congress should put their money where their mouth is since congressional staffers seem to continue to always compare military service to the civilian workforce. My recommendations for military readiness improvements are: provide a program to fund a percentage of military members’ college student loans (those who didn’t attend a service academy or didn’t utilized tuition assistance), institute an allowance program to qualifying service members for child care costs, make the officer and enlisted Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) rates the same or near the same rate, and increase the household goods (HHGs) weight allowance for our enlisted corps at least 60 percent across the board. In the late 1980s, the military changed the policy for TDY per diem for all service members. The old policy entitled officers a higher per diem rate versus our enlisted corps. This didn’t make sense to me because all service members have to eat while TDY, so why should rank factor into this? Now the per diem is the same rate. Our enlisted airmen who qualify for off-base housing need to live somewhere with their dependents, just as officers do. Why have segregated BAH rates? For example, an E-5 with dependents, assigned to the BAH Washington, D.C., area, has a BAH rate of $\$ 2,262$ , versus an O-3 with dependents, same area, having a BAH rate of $\$ 2,874$ . Why shouldn’t the E-5 earn the same BAH as the O-3? Yes, there are all types of factors influencing the BAH rate, but does the E-5 pay less for public utilities than the O-3? This is a readiness concern because when the E-5 has to support a deployment, he/she can deploy, knowing dependents’ housing will be secure. As for the HHGs weight allowance: In comparison to a federal civilian service employee, our enlisted airmen are at a disadvantage. For example, per the Defense Transportation Regulation, Part IV, for civilian employees the authorized HHGs allowance is $^ { * } 1 8 , 0 0 0$ pounds net weight for each employee” who are funded for a move. An E-5 with over 10 years’ time in service earns approximately $\$ 38,563$ annually in base pay (not factoring in other allowances), in comparison to a GS-6 (Step 7), who earns $\$ 38$ ,185 annually in pay (doesn’t include locality pay), and the GS-6 (Step 7), if authorized a move, can ship 18,000 pounds in HHGs, but the E-5 with dependents can only ship 9,000 pounds. The issue is “readiness” not “retention” because if the services jointly advocate to Congress the readiness perspective, present the facts and basis to improve readiness, then our military members, especially our great airmen, will continue to be patriotic and serve a career of 16-plus years.

# Good Mag, Bad Mag

You outdid yourselves with the March issue of Air Force Magazine! I found myself reading the whole issue from cover to cover. The clarity and strong statements in each of the articles came through loud and clear. Keep up the great work.

Lt. Col. David Newbern, USAF (Ret.) Fredericksburg, Va.

As one of the majority of voters who did not vote for President Trump, I would like to take issue with Mr. Leibundguth’s critique of your editorial policies [“Letters: Soundly Defeated,” April/May, p. 8]. Please continue to strongly question the policies and actions of the current administration, just as you did of President Obama’s.

Sean M. Mallory Edinboro, Pa.

Since becoming a member of the Air Force Association in 1968, I have anticipated receiving Air Force Magazine. Heretofore the magazine has been a refreshing alternative to the biases of the mainstream media. The content and tone of the March 2017 issue fell short of the standards set by the magazine for decades. One article in particular stands out as falling far below the standard we members expect.

“Action in Congress: Fasten Your Seatbelts” by Megan Scully [p. 13] is a thinly veiled, pedantic, anti-Trump piece that missed the mark and is an insult to our intelligence.

AFA members, whether or not they voted for the President, do not come to Air Force Magazine to ingest the same biased fodder we see in the mainstream media. We do not expect to see an irrelevant critique of the President’s “tweeting” style. The caption of the picture, “Tweeting the strike fighter,” is sophomoric.

Most, if not all of us, know that the contracting officials and not the President sign the contracting documents. But it is patently naïve to believe that the President, and other politicians, do not impact the decisions on which systems are selected. Where was Scully when Obama and Gates killed the F-22 buy? [See “State of the Arsenal,” July 2009, p. 50.]

Scully writes: “The tweet underscores his aggressive negotiation tactics, but also highlighted his unfamiliarity with some of the intricacies of Pentagon acquisition.” One can argue that the President’s negotiation tactics have proved to be successful in business. Moreover, what has transpired during the last few days to lower the costs of the F-35, since President Trump weighed in, would suggest that the President can and does influence negotiations. Apparently the “intricacies of Pentagon acquisition” that have historically resulted in protracted acquisition and cost overruns did not stymie the President who pledged to voters to drain the bureaucratic swamp.

Scully writes: “The layers of bureaucracy between the President (or any other political figure, for that matter) and the contract officer exist for good reason: to prevent any undue political influence on the process.” What is “undue political influence”? Why does

# WILSON'S POINTS

Heather A. Wilson, president of the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology and a former New Mexico congresswoman, is likely to be confirmed as the new Secretary of the Air Force, succeeding Deborah Lee James. Her nomination was approved by the Senate Armed Services Committee by a 22-to-five vote on April 5 and referred to the full Senate, where it was expected to pass without further debate, although no vote had been scheduled by press time.

President Trump nominated Wilson on Jan. 23, and she is the only one of his three initial service Secretary nominations to advance to the confirmation process. Vincent Viola and Philip Bilden, his first choices for Army and Navy Secretary, respectively, withdrew from their nominations over issues related to divestment of their financial holdings.

At her March 30 confirmation hearing, Wilson promised to push for a larger Air Force end strength, manage tightly a large bow wave of USAF modernization programs, and remain open to new contracting mechanisms and innovative schemes to develop combat capability quickly and at the lowest possible cost. She argued for repeal of the Budget Control Act (BCA) and its attending military sequester, saying the law is “hurting the Air Force and our ability to defend ourselves.”

She tallied the long list of modernization programs the Air Force must carry out in the next decade if it is to reverse the increasing age of its equipment, now standing at an average age of 27 years for aircraft. SASC Chairman Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) warned Wilson that if she were to be confirmed, the committee would not be patient with overly rosy reports on the health of acquisition programs and said flatly that if the BCA is not repealed, the Air Force won’t be able to afford all the equipment it now plans to buy.

Wilson deflected comments on reported Air Force plans to retire the F-15C/D fleet, saying the service is properly looking at all its what-if options. However, she would be willing to consider a restart of the F-22 production line as a potential offset or competitor to the F-35. Top Air Force leaders have said that while they would like to have more F-22s, increasing the buy rate on the F-35 to replace aging fighters is a higher priority and would yield more overall combat power.

Both McCain and Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) raised an ethics question for Wilson. Almost immediately after leaving her House seat in January 2009, she took consultancy work with Sandia National Laboratories—then managed by Lockheed Martin—but according to a 2013 Department of Energy inspector general report, on an invoice she did not detail the work she performed, and the lab was criticized for keeping sloppy records.

“I did the work. I complied with the contract. ... The review found ... no fault with me, and the DOE auditors never even bothered ... to talk to me,” she said.

Wilson told McCain she did the consulting work for 18 months and acknowledged she directed Lockheed’s effort to get its Sandia contract renewed without an open competition, but said she did not lobby any members of Congress in this regard. Sandia ultimately reimbursed the government $\$ 442,877$ paid to Wilson. At Sandia, Oak Ridge, and other nuclear labs, “I helped them, I think, a great deal with respect to strategic planning on nonproliferation and their nonproliferation advisory board with respect to nuclear materials, did numerous program reviews, helped with cyber security,” she told McCain. She promised him she would promote open competition on Air Force programs, but only where appropriate.

# A-10 AGAIN

Asked by Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) whether the A-10 is the ideal platform for fighting ISIS and “other asymmetrical threats,” Wilson answered obliquely that “40,000 munitions have been put on the ISIS target since 2014; 90 percent of them have been delivered by the United States Air Force. It’s an air commander who has to decide at the moment what platform he needs to do a particular job in a particular place. Whether that’s an F-16, or … [an] F-18, or an A-10 just … depends on the job.”

Though she did not address the A-10 retirement question directly, she said that fourth generation aircraft will be “around for a long time” and added, “it’s really important to get capabilities from the drawing board to the flight line faster. The cycle of innovation has to be faster.” With regard to an ongoing evaluation of the F-35 vs. the F/A-18, however, she said, “I don’t see how we can stop modernizing and expect to win a near-peer fight. And I’d rather have that fight be unfair and on our side.” She told Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) she would put fresh priority on funding for basic and applied research.

About the Air Force’s readiness crisis—with a lack of pilots and maintainers as symptoms—Wilson told McCain, “I think we all know we’re not going to get out of this in a single year.”

Wilson would be the first graduate of the Air Force Academy and the third woman to hold the service’s top position. She graduated from the academy in 1982 and, as a Rhodes scholar, continued her studies in England, receiving a master's and doctorate in international relations from Oxford University by 1985. Oxford published a book by Wilson, titled International Law and the Use of Force

by National Liberation Movements. She served on Active Duty seven years, as a host-country negotiator in the UK and then as a NATO defense planning officer, where she was also involved in arms control negotiations.

After the Air Force, Wilson worked for two years on the National Security staff in the George H. W. Bush White House, as director for Defense Policy and Arms Control. Afterward, in 1991, she founded Keystone International, Inc., in New Mexico, promoting scientific business development in the US and Russia.

Wilson served in the cabinet of New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson from 1995 to 1998, as secretary for the New Mexico Children, Youth, and Families Department, a state agency overseeing the juvenile justice system and child welfare.

She quit her post to run for Congress from New Mexico’s 1st District in 1998, winning a special election. She became the first woman veteran to serve in Congress, and after winning the general election later that year, served in the House for five more terms. Wilson served on the committees on Armed Services, Intelligence, and Energy and Commerce and chaired the Intelligence subcommittee on technical and tactical intelligence.

Wilson made two unsuccessful bids for the Senate from New Mexico, in 2008 and 2012. She took up the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology job in 2013.

# DRAGON RACES

One of the Air Force’s persistent nightmares came true in March when China, with little fanfare, declared its first stealth fighter operational. The prospect of USAF potentially confronting another air force armed with stealth aircraft, once unthinkable, is now a reality.

The dozen or so J-20 “Mighty Dragons”—announced by Chinese state television as operational on March 9—are more likely than not simply entering a period of operational test and evaluation. Their deployment at Dingxin air base in north-central China probably signals the start of exploring concepts of operation and working out how the Dragon will be integrated with other types of Chinese aircraft. From their initial perch, they pose little immediate threat to US forces in the Pacific region.

That they are there at all, however, is evidence of what former Air Combat Command chief Gen. Herbert J. “Hawk” Carlisle told Air Force Magazine in a recent interview: The Chinese are moving “faster than we expected” with regard to modernizing the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF).

Low-rate production of the J-20 seems to have begun in 2014, and in addition to the dozen aircraft at Dingxin, there are about eight other prototypes in various configurations that continue to be used for missile tests and other evaluations. The J-20, like the stealthy, supercruising American F-22 Raptor, can carry six missiles internally, and both air-to-air and air-to-ground ordnance have been seen in its weapon bays. Although the growth in China’s defense spending has slowed in the last two years, the J-20 is said to be a high priority, conferring prestige on the PLAAF and enhancing its conventional deterrent capabilities. The production rate can be expected to increase as Chengdu, the

Chinese outfit that builds the J-20, beats down the learning curve, which has been high.

The Pentagon’s 2016 Annual Report to Congress about China’s military capabilities states that the country sees stealth aircraft as providing an “offensive operational advantage that denies an adversary the time to mobilize and to conduct defensive operations.” Observers of the PLAAF say the J-20 seems optimized to make high-speed, stealthy hit-and-run attacks on ships and air bases and to attack critical airborne enablers, such as AWACS and tankers, rather than dogfighting.

# SURPRISE, SURPRISE

The J-20 was revealed in 2011, when images of a prototype circulated on the internet. Then-Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates was visiting China at the time, and the revelation was clearly meant to embarrass him. He had famously predicted that Chinese stealth fighters would not even appear until the late 2010s and not enter operational service until the 2020s. Based on that prediction, Gates terminated production of the F-22 at less than half the required inventory—a move USAF leaders have lamented since. The F-22 has proved a prodigy in combat, but the 100 or so deployable aircraft simply aren’t enough to cover all the Air Force’s air superiority obligations.

Two J-20s made the type’s air show premiere at Zhuhai, China, in November 2016, and China-watchers speculated correctly at the time that their appearance indicated operational service was imminent.

The J-20 bears a family resemblance to the F-22 and F-35, and US leaders have said in so many words that this is because of a successful Chinese cyber espionage campaign against the US defense industry since the late 1990s. Carlisle showed a split-screen image of the Chinese J-31 and US F-35 at AFA’s Air Warfare Symposium in March, and it was hard to tell the difference between them. The J-20 sports a chin-mounted electro-optical targeting system externally identical to that on the F-35.

Outwardly, the Air Force doesn’t express too much concern about the J-20. At a state of the Air Force press briefing last August, USAF Chief of Staff Gen. David L. Goldfein said comparing the F-22 and F-35 against the J-20 and J-31 is “almost an irrelevant comparison” because the US has a decided advantage when it comes to networking its systems to provide an unmatched picture of the battlespace to combat pilots and operational commanders alike. At a February speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Goldfein said, “It’s not about what the F-35, or the J-20, or the F-22, or the J-31 can actually do ... one-versus-one.” While that’s an “interesting” discussion, he said, “it’s actually not very compelling because we’re not going to ever have an F-35 in there by itself, ever. We do ‘family of systems.’ ”

Privately, though, senior USAF leaders say the introduction of a stealthy adversary sharply complicates the air battle. “We’ve known this was coming a long time, and we’ve prepared,” said one, “but it means we’re going to have to do things [differently], and we knew we would have a harder time on the front end” of any potential conflict with China or a Chinese-supplied client.

# The tyranny of distance; Singular circumstances; Bolstering security; Supporting Somalia ....

# ENABLERS

The bulk of Flintlock—US Africa Command’s premier special operations forces exercise—is based on one-to-one contact between troops on the ground. But about 60 Ohio Air National Guardsmen played a critical role in this year’s iteration: transporting people and equipment via air around a training area nearly twice the size of the continental United States.

More than 20 countries and 2,000 people participated in Exercise Flintlock 2017. It included events in Chad, Niger, Burkina Faso, Morocco, Tunisia, Cameroon, and Mauritania.

“We’re a force enabler, we’re able to bridge the gap between these large geographical locations,” said Lt. Col. Jeremy Ford, the director of operations for the 164th Airlift Squadron, 179th Airlift Wing, from Mansfield, Ohio. He served as director of the air operations center for Exercise Flintlock, headquartered in N’Djamena, Chad.

“We’re solving the tyranny of distance for this exercise,” Ford told Air Force Magazine.

The multinational activity is designed to build and strengthen partnerships and build the capacity to help the African nations “protect the civilian population, particularly against crossborder attacks from violent extremist groups,” Ford said.

The unit sent two C-130s and some five dozen people to Africa for the exercise, and as the “primary airlift mover” for Flintlock, they transported more than 400 people and 50 tons of cargo over the course of three weeks.

# HOT, DUSTY, SANDY

“These conditions, you can’t simulate back in the state of Ohio,” Ford said. “So being here in Africa with the hot, sandy, dusty conditions, where we’ve got to work through challenges with a limited amount of resources, … we had to kind of think outside the box and become creative.”

Ford said the exercise provided critical operational experience the airmen can use in the future and an opportunity for the unit to hone its skills as a force multiplier for Active Duty troops, particularly special operations forces.

“All these contingency operations we’re involved in today, it’s not just our Active Duty forces. It’s a combination of Active Duty, ANG, and Reserve forces. So when we’re able to train together and work together in an environment like this, it makes us more interoperable and it makes a better Total Force package,” Ford explained. “That real-world experience is going to pay off in the future for us.”

Ford said the airmen “learned a lot from this exercise about what we can expect from our special operations forces if we ever wanted to integrate with them in the future.”

Flintlock was also a way to increase interoperability with African partner nations and Western partner nations, he said.

Chadian Brig. Gen. Zakaria Ngobongue noted at the exercise’s opening ceremony that the environment “is plagued with insecurity” and said that Flintlock is “a great opportunity for our special forces to benefit from the shared training of participating nations.”

179th Airlift Wing aircraft maintainers from the Ohio Air National Guard prepare a C-130 for the Flintlock 17 exercise.

“Terrorism, one of the major dangers of the third millennium, threatens the stability of states and security of citizens while fueling violence and hatred,” Ngobongue said.

The Air Guardsmen weren’t the only USAF personnel involved in the exercise; several Air Force Special Operations Command troops embedded in US Special Operations Command Africa participated, as well. Many were involved in medical training on the ground, Ford said.

“We’ve done the first-ever Chadian [casualty evacuation] training here in Chad this year, with our AFSOC folks and our Air Guard aircraft,” Ford explained.

The event included training on the ground and more in the air, with soldiers playing roles as patients, he said.

# GOING AFTER AL-SHABAB

Also in March, President Donald J. Trump approved a plan to provide offensive air strikes for the African Union Mission and efforts to defeat al-Shabab militants in Somalia. The authorization designated Somalia as an “active area of hostilities” for 180 days.

“This authority is consistent with our approach of developing capable Somali security forces and supporting regional partners in their efforts to combat al-Shabab,” Pentagon spokesman Navy Capt. Jeff Davis told reporters at the Pentagon.

Davis said the help will increase pressure on the Islamic militant group.

“We stand with the international community in supporting the federal government of Somalia as it strives to improve stability and security in Somalia. The additional support provided by this authority will help deny al-Shabab safe havens from which it could attack US citizens or US interests in the region,” Davis stated.

Every day, V-22 Ospreys are making a critical difference around the globe—executing combat, search and rescue, humanitarian, MEDEVAC and special operations missions in a fraction of the time of conventional rotorcraft. The tiltrotor’s unique blend of helicopter and turboprop performance is making it the platform of choice where speed, long range and survivability make all the difference.

# All Mattis on Deck

Defense Secretary James N. Mattis has had the unenviable job of presiding over his first budget drill—including the distribution of an additional $\$ 54$ billion for defense accounts next year—without any of his key civilian lieutenants in place.

Typically, a small army of Pentagon appointees, from the military services to the Office of the Secretary of Defense, weighs in on the annual budget, helping establish policy and priorities for a department that consumes more than $\$ 600$ billion annually.

But President Donald J. Trump has been slow to name his picks for the Pentagon’s most prestigious posts, leaving Mattis as the sole Trump appointee through much of the formation of the Fiscal 2018 budget request.

By early April, Heather A. Wilson, the President’s choice for Air Force Secretary, was the only defense nominee officially pending before the Senate. With about a month to go before the anticipated release of budget details, Trump had voiced his intention to nominate several people for other top jobs, including key budget positions like deputy secretary and comptroller.

In mid-March, the administration claimed a topline for defense spending that exceeds budget caps for next year by $\$ 54$ billion to help improve what the new Commander in Chief considers a depleted military.

Trump has made clear that aircraft, including advanced fighters, and ships are among his top priorities. But the administration won’t reveal the individual line items and their justifications until the full budget release later this spring, giving the department time to match the budget to the administration’s policies.

With Mattis alone at the Pentagon for the first several months of the administration, the task of drafting the budget falls to those who remain in the department, including Obama administration holdovers like Robert O. Work, who continued in his role as the No. 2 civilian. Many of those officials are budget veterans and perfectly capable of drafting the 2018 proposal, but their priorities may not line up with the new administration’s.

Meanwhile, career civilians and military officials are always heavily involved in the budget process but, in the absence of Senate-confirmed appointees, presumably have more sway this year. Like Obama holdovers, however, they do not have a stake in the politics and policies of the new administration.

All of this means that, while the budget will get done, longterm policies may have to wait until next year. The administration’s first real crack at using the defense budget to set the national security agenda likely will come in Fiscal 2019, after Trump’s picks have settled into the Pentagon.

In the meantime, however, Mattis and his team, once they receive Senate confirmation, will have to sell the request to Congress, a task made all the more difficult because of the additional defense funding requested for next year.

Indeed, the $\$ 54$ billion plus-up seems to have irked both sides of the aisle before the release of the formal budget request.

![](images/6ee81005f2f913d7f7313706118ea71c308709f1f3447381569e425740bef148.jpg)  
Secretary of Defense James Mattis, here with Army Gen. Joseph Votel, head of US Central Command, is alone at the top.

Defense hawks such as the chairmen of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees don’t think it’s generous enough and would like to see another $\$ 37$ billon added to the Pentagon topline next year to pay for the military’s stated requirements, such as accelerated purchases of the F-35 strike fighter, and to boost lagging readiness levels.

During Wilson’s March confirmation hearing, Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) warned of a modernization bow wave facing the service, ticking off a number of expensive programs like the F-35, KC-46A tanker, and B-21 bomber.

“There is simply no way all of these important, yet expensive modernization programs will fit into the Air Force budget as constrained by the Budget Control Act,” McCain said. “It will be your task to develop and make the case for a path through this tremendous budget crunch.”

Democrats—particularly in the Senate, where 60 votes are required to pass any contentious legislation—may pose an even more difficult challenge to the Trump administration’s proposed defense boost.

The minority party has opposed previous GOP efforts to raise defense caps without a similar increase in nondefense spending. With deep cuts proposed at the State Department and for domestic programs, Democrats may wield their filibuster power to get more of their priorities funded. The result could be a stalled appropriations process across the federal government.

Senate Appropriations Ranking Member Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) stressed during a March hearing that national security doesn’t fall only to the Defense Department, arguing that failure to invest in America will make the world less secure.

“While we must ensure that we do not have a ‘hollow force,’ we must also avoid a ‘hollow country,’” he said. “That is precisely what President Trump’s budget proposes,” Leahy asserted.

# Breaking Faith

“Pilots who don’t fly, maintainers who don’t maintain, air traffic controllers [who] don’t control—leave. ... An extended CR [continuing resolution] will also negate the pilot bonuses Congress authorized, which will ... break faith with the force. ... As a service Chief, I have many obligations, but one remains paramount: Every airman we send into harm’s way must be properly organized, trained, and equipped, and led to succeed in [his or her] mission. ... This is our moral obligation. A yearlong CR makes meeting this obligation extremely difficult.”—Gen. David L. Goldfein, USAF Chief of Staff, House Armed Services Committee, April 5.

# Turnabout

“The traditional warfighting paradigm of ground forces leading the fight supported by air forces has been supplanted by a construct where air forces supported by ground forces is often a much more responsive, effective, efficient, and less costly—in terms of both lives and dollars—manner in which to conduct warfare.”—Retired USAF Lt. Gen. David A. Deptula, prepared statement to Senate Armed Services airland subcommittee, Feb. 9.

# Vlad Vs. the Impaler

# Top of the Pack

“I am the first one that would like to see ... nobody have nukes, but we’re never going to fall behind any country, even if it’s a friendly country. We’re never going to fall behind on nuclear power. ... It would be wonderful, a dream would be that no country would have nukes, but if countries are going to have nukes, we’re going to be at the top of the pack.”—President Donald J.

# Hard Truth

“No longer can the American taxpayer carry a disproportionate share of the defense of Western values. Americans cannot care more for your children’s future security than you do.”—Secretary of Defense James N. Mattis, address to NATO defense ministers in Brussels, Feb. 15.

# Naval Confusion

“We went from [a policy of] ‘Let’s not talk about gay people’ to complex conversations of gender identity and bathrooms. We leapfrogged 10 years of social growth in the Navy, and people from leadership all the way down to the deck plates did not know what to make of it.”—Retired Navy Capt. Rick Hoffman, Navy Times, Feb. 4.

# Abracadabra ... Not

“So much of what [USAF] does is assumed capability, and the way I describe it is it’s like a light switch. ... I actually don’t know how lights work, ... but here’s what I know. I know that when I walk into this room, I flip that switch and those lights come on. ... Much of what we do as an Air Force has become a light switch. ‘I don’t know how I got three bars on my GPS phone. It ... just happens. It’s magic.’ No, it ain’t magic. It’s 31 satellites being flown by airmen at Schriever Air Force Base right now. ... So here’s my concern: [If] we don’t put the resources against some of these key mission sets that the entire joint team relies on, those lights aren’t going to come on.”—Gen. David L. Goldfein, USAF Chief of Staff, remarks at Center for Strategic and International Studies, Feb. 23.

# The Warbot Cometh

“The winner of the next conflict will not likely be determined primarily by the state of their technologies, but by how well a nation’s military thinkers conceptualize future warfare in an integrated manner and then apply robotic systems, or warbots. ... ‘Warbots’ can be defined as robotic combat systems that can detect, identify, and apply lethal force to enemy combatants within prescribed parameters and without immediate human intervention. ... Most militaries continue to look at warbots as support weapons ... because it is easier to keep humans in the loop. ... Yet warbots offer tremendous potential advantages as primary combatants. They are simply more capable, cheaper, and offer less risk to humans than manned equivalents in many, if not most, combat situations.”—US Army Col. Brian M. Michelson, senior fellow at Atlantic Council, writing in The Bridge, Feb. 28.

# Gag Those Terrorists

“If you can’t talk, you can’t fight. It’s that simple. Our job is to create massive confusion in the Daesh [a pejorative Arabic nickname for ISIS] network.

The US will continue to recognize Japanese administration of the islands and, as such, Article 5 [collective defense] of the US-Japan Security Treaty applies.”— Secretary of Defense James N. Mattis, joint press conference with Japanese Defense Minister Tomomi Inada, Feb. 4. The Senkakus are claimed by both Japan and China.

# Hope for the Hollow

“The important thing to me is this [the Trump administration’s proposed increase in DOD spending] is a clear statement of recognition that we are heading towards a hollow force. There’s not just a readiness crisis. There’s enormous modernization challenges, and you have trouble maintaining [operational] tempo. That’s the textbook definition of a force that’s heading to hollow.”—James Jay Carafano, Heritage Foundation national security specialist, quoted in defensenews.com, Feb. 27.

# ■ The Air Force’s Low Aircraft Availability Rates

Across nearly all of its combat and mobility aircraft, the Air Force is failing to meet aircraft availability standards, according to data the service recently provided to Congress.

“The Air Force has a challenge in aircraft availability, and we are trying to shore that up,” Col. Michael Lawrence, chief of the maintenance division in the logistics directorate, told Air Force Magazine.

Aircraft availability measures what percent of an entire aircraft fl eet is ready to perform its primary mission and, unlike more commonly cited mission capable rates, includes aircraft undergoing major repairs or overhauls. It offers “a mechanism to understand the relative health of any fl eet,” he said. The data show that in the fourth quarter of 2016, 16 of the 17 USAF aircraft fl eets included in the survey had availability rates below the standard that indicates a fl eet in good health. Additionally, only six of the 17 aircraft types had availability rates within fi ve percentage points of the standard, considered by maintainers as an acceptable deviation from the norm.

While warning that “every weapons system has its own story,” Lawrence said three main factors contribute to the servicewide low rates of aircraft availability. Some of the lowest rates during that time period were among platforms undergoing service life extension programs, like the B-1 and B-2.

Here, “there is a need to prepare for a near-peer adversary,” Lawrence said. “It’s painful to take these aircraft off the front lines, but we know we’ve got to do it.”

The F-22A Raptor also suffered a low availability rate, at 46 percent. Lawrence said this was primarily caused by work on the aircraft’s stealthy low observable platform surfaces.

An F-15E takes off from RAF Lakenheath, UK, in February.

Second, as the average age of the Air Force inventory increases, “the amount of time we have to spend working on those aircraft tends to increase,” leaving them in the depots longer.

Third, “the maintenance manpower shortfall” has had an impact on aircraft availability. The data were provided to the House Armed Services readiness subcommittee ahead of a March 22 hearing on the current state of the Air Force.

The AFMC Accident Investigation Board determined the contract personnel did not ensure the drain holes were uncovered during an inspection after a washing and during four prefl ight inspections.

# ■ Maintenance Error Causes $\$ 7.35$ Million in Damage

Contract maintainers left drain holes covered during depot maintenance of an E-8C JSTARS between March 2015 and July 2016. This let water accumulate and caused about $\$ 7.35$ million in damage to the aircraft, according to an Air Force Materiel Command investigation.

The E-8C, assigned to the 116th Air Control Wing at Robins AFB, Ga., was in depot maintenance at a Northrop Grumman facility in Lake Charles, La. During the maintenance, contractor personnel covered three holes in the radome on the belly of the aircraft. Water from washings and rain collected

# ■ Holmes Takes Command of ACC

Gen. James M. “Mike” Holmes assumed control of Air Combat Command from Gen. Herbert J. “Hawk” Carlisle on March 10 during a ceremony at JB Langley-Eustis, Va. Holmes previously served as USAF deputy chief of staff for strategic plans and requirements at the Pentagon. Carlisle, who had led the command since 2014, retired after 39 years in uniform.

# Holmes

“There has never been a more important time to serve in uniform, and you truly represent the greatest treasure in our nation’s arsenal,” Chief of Staff Gen. David L. Goldfein told the audience of ACC airmen during the ceremony. Carlisle said, “I have absolute, complete confidence in Mike Holmes and Sarah, that they are the right team to lead this command in the future and to greater heights.”

“Northrop maintenance quality assurance inspectors were required to ensure all drain holes were free from obstructions after being washed, but failed to do so,” the report states. “The accumulated water, and subsequent cycling of the antenna, which produced an electrical current, damaged the antenna’s electrical components.”

After assuming command, Holmes told the ACC airmen, “We now face new and revised challenges from both great and regional powers who threaten the survival of our American experiment.” He went on to say the ability of the nation to fend off these threats “certainly depends on the capabilities you bring as part of a joint team.”

The Air Force has not determined if Northrop Grumman will incur a fi nancial penalty for the incident; however, the maintenance contract lets the service evaluate if the contractor’s performance merits the payment of an award fee, according to AFMC.

# ■ THAAD Deployment Begins in South Korea

A C­17 delivered the first elements of a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system to Osan AB, South Korea, in early March.

“The timely deployment of the THAAD system by US Pacific Command and the Secretary of Defense gives my command great confidence in the support we will receive when we ask for reinforcement or advanced capabilities,” the US Forces Korea commander, Army Gen. Vincent K. Brooks, said in a news release.

The deployment came the same day North Korea launched four ballistic missiles into the Sea of Japan. Defense Secretary James N. Mattis and Japanese Minister of Defense Tomomi Inada agreed “that these launches are an unacceptable and irresponsible act” that undermines stability in the region, according to a Pentagon statement.

# ■ It’s Official: USAF Needs a Minimum of 100 B-21s

The Air Force’s requirement for the B­21 Raider bomber, initially stated as $\mathfrak { a } _ { 0 }$ to ${ 1 0 0 } ^ { \mathfrak { n } }$ airplanes, is now officially at least 100 aircraft, the Air Force said. Written testimony presented to the House Armed Services Committee by Vice Chief of Staff Gen. Stephen W. Wilson indicated that 100 is now the minimum number of B­21s required.

Through a spokesman, the Air Force confirmed the number, saying the change happened “in spring $2 0 1 6 "$ at the request of Air Force Global Strike Command. At that time, USAF established 100 “as the floor—not the ceiling” for the B­21 fleet size, he said. AFGSC “requires a minimum of 100 B­21 Raider aircraft, with a mix of legacy bombers, to meet future COCOM [combatant commander] requirements,” the spokesman said.

He said that AFGSC chief Gen. Robin Rand told AFA’s Mitchell Institute in July last year that 100 aircraft, and “not one single one below that,” was his “best military advice” on the B­21 fleet size.

# ■ Air Force To Increase Rotational Presence in Europe

The Air Force will increase its rotational presence in Europe thanks to a significant boost in European Reassurance Initiative funding in the Fiscal 2017 budget, US Air Forces in Europe Commander Gen. Tod D. Wolters said at AFA’s Air Warfare Symposium. The increased number of theater security packages will be “equivalent to what you see with the introduction of the brigade combat team” in Europe, he said.

In November 2016, the Army announced plans to deploy 5,700 troops from two brigades to Europe for Operation Atlantic Resolve, which provides reassurance to NATO allies in response to Russian aggression in the region. Wolters said he’s also “very excited about the insertion” of four multinational battlegroups in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland on a rotational basis.

![](images/ccc4dfa1f62fe5b00f64f3f918edb615405a74ae632898b5c626c5c62c7b5a05.jpg)

“I can’t imagine how I would deal with the missions I have, with fewer bombers than we have in today’s inventory,” Rand said in his Mitchell remarks. Because of the B­21’s secrecy, it was not explained then that Rand’s advice had become official policy.

# US Central Command Operations: Freedom’s Sentinel and Inherent Resolve

# ■ Casualties

As of April 18, a total of 35 Americans had died in Operation Freedom’s Sentinel in Afghanistan, and 39 Americans had died in Operation Inherent Resolve in Iraq and Syria.

The total includes 71 troops and three Department of Defense civilians. Of these deaths, 31 were killed in action with the enemy while 43 died in noncombat incidents.

There have been 165 troops wounded in action during OFS and 34 troops in OIR.

# ■ Civilian Deaths in Mosul Air Strike Investigated

US Central Command is investigating a March 17 strike in Mosul that reportedly killed more than 100 civilians. The strike in Mosul’s al-Jadida neighborhood hit a building where more than 100 people were hiding. Iraqi security forces requested the strike, which targeted ISIS fi ghters and equipment, Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve said.

CENTCOM chief Army Gen. Joseph L. Votel said in a statement that the death of the civilians is a tragedy, and “we are investigating the incident to determine exactly what happened and will continue to take extraordinary measures to avoid harming civilians.” The fi ght in Mosul is diffi cult because ISIS fi ghters are operating among civilians.

# ■ Death of Top Al Qaeda, Taliban Leaders Confi rmed

A Febuary air strike killed Mullah Abdul Salam, the Taliban’s commander for the province of Kunduz. The

Taliban said a remotely piloted aircraft killed Salam, along with four of his top associates.

“Mullah Salam and the Taliban fighters under him murdered and terrorized the people of Kunduz for too long,” said Army Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr., commander of US forces in Afghanistan, according to Voice of America.

The Department of Defense also confirmed that a March 19 US air strike in Paktika province, Afghanistan, killed high-ranking al Qaeda leader Qari Yasin. A native of Pakistan, Yasin helped plan a September 2008 bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad that killed dozens, including USAF Maj. Rodolfo I. Rodriguez and Navy 3rd Class Petty Officer Matthew J. O’Bryant. Yasin was also implicated in a 2009 attack on a bus carrying the Sri Lankan cricket team in Lahore.

“The death of Qari Yasin is evidence that terrorists who defame Islam and deliberately target innocent people will not escape justice,” said Secretary of Defense James N. Mattis, in a DOD press release.

# ■ Three US Soldiers Injured in Insider Attack

Three US soldiers stationed at Camp Antonik, in the Washer district of Helmand province, were wounded there when an Afghan soldier opened fire on them March 19. Coalition forces on base responded and killed the shooter, according to US Forces Afghanistan.

The shooting was the first insider attack on US forces in Afghanistan this year.

# What Is the Intelligence Community?

President Donald Trump’s new administration has been at odds with the Intelligence Community (IC) from the onset, to put it mildly.

In mid-February, news outlets announced that the White House planned a broad review of American intelligence agencies.

The news came the same day Trump blamed the Intelligence Community for leaks resulting in his National Security Advisor Michael T. Flynn’s resignation.

The next day, the FBI released 398 pages of documents connected to a 1973 Justice Department lawsuit against Trump that alleged housing discrimination by his real estate company in New York City.

Tensions between the President and the IC have been high since before the election, so what exactly is the Intelligence Community?

# TWO PARTS OF THE DNI’S BUDGET

1. The national intelligence program consists of all Intelligence Community programs, projects, and activities that primarily support more than one department or agency or provide a service of common concern for the IC.

2. The military intelligence program comprises intelligence programs, projects, and activities that primarily support military operations or address a unique Department of Defense requirement.

Simply put, the IC is a group of 16 intelligence agencies or departments, like the FBI and NSA, and the overseer of them all is the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The ODNI, created by 2004 legislation, exists to integrate efforts, make operations efficient, and communicate succinctly with the White House.

Trump chose former Republican Sen. Dan Coats of Indiana to be his Director of National Intelligence, and the Senate confirmed him in midMarch.

The DNI’s budget is broken into two parts. A DNI spokesperson told Air Force Magazine the office doesn’t disclose details about its budget or how it’s allocated among the intel community, nor how many employees each component has.

For 2016, DNI requested $\$ 53.9$ billion for its national intelligence program, or the part of the budget addressing the Intelligence Community. It received $\$ 53$ billion.

# Life at Bagram

# forces in country declines, much still stays the same.

n January, the number of US military personnel inside Afghanistan decreased to about 8,500 focused on both Operation Resolute Support, the continuing commitment to training, advising, and assisting the Afghan forces, and Operation Freedom’s Sentinel, the military mission to target the Taliban, al Qaeda, and now ISIS in the country. The majority of these forces are at Bagram, home of the Air Force’s 455th Air Expeditionary Wing. US, NATO, and Afghan aircraft line the two, 9,800-plus foot long airstrips and 32 acres of ramp space.

The wing includes about 2,000 airmen, fl ying and maintaining dozens of aircraft that make their way through the fi ght in Afghanistan.

That number has dropped in recent years, however. Bagram houses only one dedicated fi ghter squadron for the operations. In January, that unit was the 79th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron deployed from Shaw AFB, S.C. The F-16s of the 79th stay on call, able to fl y anywhere in the country within one hour to conduct close air support.

“Even though there is only one person in the airplane, we always fl y as a team,” Major Joseph, the squadron’s director of operations, said in a news release. (The Air Force doesn’t provide the last names of deployed combat pilots.) This gives the pilot “access to countless resources.”

These combat aircraft have been increasingly busy in Afghanistan, as fi ghts against the Taliban and ISIS have increased.

A 79th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron F-16 is prepared for a mission on Jan. 13, 2017, at Bagram Airfi eld, Afghanistan. For thousands of airmen, Bagram is, at least for now, home.

![](images/e197738c4898e16141c6c396883e81db20cf15de303b5395ba67d30e04213b4d.jpg)

![](images/52919d850f8a5d492425dafc25d47bf8d44585aaf60470fa2cc8113623c70435.jpg)

In February, US aircraft dropped 200 bombs in Afghanistan. This is the highest since October 2016—and the second highest since September 2014. This uptick came after the Obama administration in 2015 gave US forces increased authority to go after ISIS, and USAF took on that mission without boosting the number of deployed aircraft.

The combat effort has continued from Bagram even as the amount of tanker support at the base has dropped. As of early 2017, the Air Force no longer deploys tankers to the base full time and instead flies support missions from outside the country, said Maj. Gen. Jay B. Silveria, deputy commander of US Air Forces Central Command.

The Air Force keeps rescue aircraft, including HH-60G Pave Hawks, and aircrews deployed to Bagram on alert for personnel recovery missions. A flow of mobility aircraft and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft rotate through Bagram’s massive apron.

The Air Force’s longest deployed unit in Afghanistan passed 15 years in country in January. The 41st Electronic Combat Squadron and the 755th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron of Davis-Monthan AFB, Ariz., have been continuously deployed with their EC130H Compass Call aircraft since Operation Enduring Freedom began and have been at Bagram since 2004. The Compass Call disrupts enemy command and control by “jamming” electronics. The 41st has flown more than 39,000 hours during 6,800 combat sorties in Afghanistan.

The renewed threat from the Taliban means that as of March, some 15-and-a-half years since combat began, “we are at a stalemate,” US Central Command chief Army Gen. Joseph L. Votel told lawmakers in late March. “But stalemates have a tendency to decline over time.”

NATO as of early 2017 has a 13,000-member force deployed as part of the International Security Assistance Force for the Resolute Support mission, with its hub at Bagram. The number in Afghanistan peaked at 130,000 in 2011. Those at Bagram not focused on counterterrorism work with the Afghan force to build its capability, and for the US Air Force that involves helping to stand up and assist in the operation of Afghanistan’s small but busy fleet.

more combat operations. The Afghan air force also flies USmade MD-530 attack helicopters, C-130 cargo aircraft, and Mi-17 cargo helicopters, among others. All need US support and training to maintain combat capability. While the Afghan forces have a limited training pipeline and have struggled to identify enough candidates, they have been effective in combat.

As of summer 2016, the Super Tucanos have fl own two to four combat missions every week. They are “rapidly gaining capability” with help from US trainers and advisors, US Army Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr., commander of the Resolute Support mission, said in a December press briefi ng.

“It’s important to remember that fi ve years ago, when we started building the Afghan security forces, we had about 140,000 US and coalition troops in the country,” Nicholson said. “We are now down to less than one-tenth of that. Today it’s the Afghan security forces who are responsible for securing their own country, with the assistance of our advisory and [counterterrorism] effort.”

The US military’s footprint inside Afghanistan has dwindled from its peak during the almost 16-year war, but for the thousands of troops that remain inside the walls of Bagram Airfi eld, Afghanistan is their temporary home and the misson endures.

On the following pages appears a variety of information and statistical material about the US Air Force—its people, organization, equipment, fund ing, activities, bases, and heroes. This Almanac section was compiled by Brendan McGarry and the staff of Air Force Magazine under the direction of Gideon Grudo. We especially acknowledge the help of the Secretary of the Air Force Offi ce of Public Affairs, Air Staff agencies, major commands, and reserve components in bringing up to date the comparable data from last year’s Almanac.

# Structure of the Force

There is considerable variation in how the major commands and subordinate units of the Air Force are organized. This overview describes the Air Force’s primary organizational structures.

■ DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DOD) A Cabinet agency headed by the Secretary of Defense. It comprises three military departments— Air Force, Army, and Navy—each with a civilian Secretary.

■ JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF DOD’s corporate military leadership. The Chairman and vice chairman serve full time in their positions, while the service chiefs also serve as the military heads of their respective services.

# Current Air Force Leaders

■ SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE Lisa S. Disbrow (acting): Jan. 20, 2017 ■ AIR FORCE CHIEF OF STAFF Gen. David L. Goldfein: July 1, 2016 ■ CHIEF MASTER SERGEANT OF THE AIR FORCE CMSAF Kaleth O. Wright: Feb. 17, 2017

■ DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE Headed by the Secretary of the Air Force. Supporting the SECAF are the Secretariat Staff and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, who oversees the Air Staff, among other duties. The heads of the major commands report to the CSAF.

■ MAJOR COMMAND Most Air Force units fall under a majcom, having broad functional responsibilities. Majcoms are organized under a unit-oriented scheme, with one or more numbered air forces, or a major non-unit scheme, with one or more centers.

■ WING The predominant command entity within USAF. The typical Air Force base is built around a wing.

GROUP Four groups make up a standard wing, covering operations (operates primary mission equipment and includes such functions as intelligence); maintenance (provides weapon system maintenance); mission support (provides base support and services, including civil engineer, logistics readiness, and security forces); and medical.

■ SQUADRON The basic organizational building block of the Air Force. Squadrons generally work under one of the four groups to provide either mission or functional support.

■ FLIGHTS Several flights may exist within squadrons.

■ FOAs, DRUs, AUXILIARY The Air Force organization also includes field operating agencies (FOAs), carrying out specialized activities; direct reporting units (DRUs), performing specific missions not covered by majcoms; and an auxiliary.

# We are YOUR Air Force Association We are AIRMEN for LIFE

For a \$45/year Membership or a \$30/year E-Membership, you too can be part of an organization that believes whether you are Active Duty, Guard, Reserve, or Civil Air Patrol; in uniform or civilian; students, cadets, or family members – we are all Airmen for Life.

The Air Force Association exists so we can all be Airmen for Life.   
It is the very foundation on which General Jimmy Doolittle built AFA.

Of course the world and the Air Force have changed a lot since 1946. However, one fact remains unchanged: We are all Airmen who believe deeply in a dominant Air Force for our nation.

Some $\$ 5$ billion was budgeted in 2017 for the F-35A Lightning II.

Funding levels can be expressed in several ways. Budget authority is the value of new obligations the federal government is authorized to incur, including some obligations to be met in later years. Figures can also be expressed in outlays (actual expenditures, some of which are covered by amounts previously authorized).

Another difference concerns the value of money. When funding is in current or then-year dollars, it is not adjusted for inflation. This is the actual amount of dollars that has been or is to be spent, budgeted, or forecast. When funding is expressed in constant dollars, or real dollars, the effect of inflation has been taken into account to make direct comparisons between budget years possible. A specific year, often the present one, is chosen as a baseline for constant dollars.

Normally, Congress first authorizes payment, then appropriates it. Authorization establishes or continues a federal program or agency and sets forth guidelines to which it must adhere. Appropriation enables federal agencies to spend money for specific purposes.

# About the FY18 Budget

President Donald Trump in March released a Fiscal 2018 budget blueprint of $\$ 639$ billion for the Defense Department, including $\$ 574$ billion for the base budget and $\$ 65$ billion for Overseas Contingency Operations. However, as of mid-April, the Pentagon hadn’t released its offi cial budget request for the fi scal year beginning Oct. 1. As a result, this year’s edition of the almanac uses fi gures from last year’s defense budget (adjusted for infl ation), except where the Pentagon’s supplemental 2017 budget request provides more current data.

# Major Commands and Reserve Components

2017 USAF Almanac

# Organization

The Air Force has 10 major commands and two Air Reserve Components. (Air Force Reserve Command is both a majcom and an ARC.)

■ MAJOR COMMANDS As signifi cant subdivisions of the Air Force, majcoms conduct a considerable part of the service’s mission and are directly subordinate to Headquarters, USAF.

Major commands are organized on a functional basis in the US and on a geographic basis overseas. In addition to accomplishing designated portions of USAF’s worldwide activities, they organize, administer, equip, and train their subordinate elements.

Majcoms, in general, include the following organizational levels: numbered air force (NAF), wing, group, squadron, and fl ight. The majcom sits at the top of a skip-eche

lon staffi ng s t r u c t u r e , which means every other organizational level (i.e., majcom, wing, and squadron) will have a f range of staff fun

The other organizations (NAF, group, and flight) are tactical, mission-centered echelons. These tactical echelons are designed to increase operational effectiveness without the burden of additional support staff functions.

There are two basic organizational schemes for Air Force major commands: unit-oriented organizations and major nonunit organizations. The standard unitoriented scheme comprises majcom, NAF, wing, group, squadron, and flight levels. Alternatively, a majcom may oversee a center, directorate, division, branch, and section levels, or a combination thereof.

USAF has two types of major commands: lead majcom and component majcom (C-majcom). Some major commands are both lead majcoms and C-majcoms.

■ COMPONENT MAJCOM A C-majcom is the USAF component to a unifi ed combatant command. The commander of a C-majcom

is the commander of air force forces (COM - AFFOR) and may function as a theater joint force air and space component commander (JFACC) hen required. A C-majcom e or more component NAFs (C-NAFs) through which it presents its (C-NAFs) forces to the combatant commander.forces

■ NUMBERED AIR FORCE A numbered air force, that level of command directly below a major command, provides operational leadership and supervision to its subordinate units: wings, groups, and squadrons. A C-NAF supports the commander of air forces at the operational and tactical level. USAF has designated some C-NAFs, rather than a majcom, as the Air Force component to a unified combatant command. In that role, the C-NAF functions at the strategic level as well as the operational and tactical levels and has a broader staff. (On the following pages, NAFs with “Air Forces” designations, such as Air Forces Southern, are C-NAFs.)

# BOMBER AIRCRAFT

# ■ B-1 LANCER

Brief: Long-range penetrating bomber capable of delivering the largest weapon load of any aircraft in the Air Force inventory.

# COMMENTARY

The B-1A was initially proposed as a replacement for the B-52, and four prototypes were developed and tested before program cancellation in 1977. The program was revived in 1981 as the B-1B. The vastly upgraded aircraft added 74,000 lb of usable payload, improved radar, and reduced radar cross section, but cut speed to Mach 1.2. B-1B saw fi rst combat in Iraq during Desert Fox in 1998. Its three internal weapons bays hold a substantial payload, allowing different weapons in each bay. The bomber’s blended wing/body confi guration, variable-geometry design, and turbofan engines provide long range and loiter time. Offensive avionics include SAR for terrain-following and tracking and targeting moving vehicles. Sniper pod was added in 2008. The ongoing integrated battle station modifi - cations is the most comprehensive refresh in the bomber’s history. The three-part upgrade includes the Vertical Situation Display (VSD), which adds a digital cockpit, Fully Integrated Data Link (FIDL) to enhance targeting, command and control, and Central Integrated Test System (CITS), giving aircrew real-time aircraft diagnostics and simplifying maintenance and troubleshooting. FIDL includes Link 16 and Joint Range Extension data link, enabling permanent secure LOS/BLOS/C2. It also adds Ethernet to enable rapid airborne retargeting. Ongoing life extension efforts will stretch service life to 2040. The fi rst Sustainment Block 16 airframe was redelivered to Ellsworth AFB, S.D., in May

2016. FY17 funds support development of higher powered Military Code (M-Code) jam-resistant GPS interface. B-1s resumed Pacifi c presence rotations to Guam in 2016.

# ■ B-2 SPIRIT

Brief: Stealthy, long-range nuclear and conventional strike bomber.

# COMMENTARY

The B-2 is a fl ying wing that combines LO stealth design with high aerodynamic effi ciency. Spirit entered combat against Serb targets during Allied Force on March 24, 1999. B-2 production was completed in three successive blocks and all aircraft were upgraded to Block 30 standards with AESA radar. AESA paves the way for future advanced weapons integration including Long-Range Standoff (LRSO) missile and B61-12 bomb. The aircraft’s smoothly blended “fuselage” holds two weapons bays capable of carrying nearly 60,000 lb of weapons in various combinations. New EHF satcom and high-speed computer upgrade recently entered full production. Both are part of the Defensive Management System-Modernization (DMSM). FY16 began production funding for a new VLF receiver to provide redundancy, and FY17 starts include radio cryptographic modernization for UHF/VHF comms, and a new Adaptable Communications Suite (ACS) to provide timesensitive mission data, targeting, intelligence, and C2 updates. AEHF comms will provide two-way, survivable communications for nuclear missions in A2/AD environments. Weapons integration includes the improved GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, JASSM-ER, and future weapons such as GBU-53 SDB II, GBU-56 Laser JDAM, JDAM-5000, and LRSO. Flexible Strike Package mods will feed GPS data to the weapons bays, allowing prerelease guidance to thwart jamming. Phase 2 will allow nuclear and conventional weapons to be

# ■ B-52 STRATOFORTRESS

Brief: Long-range bomber capable of free-fall nuclear or conventional weapon delivery or cruise missile carriage.

# COMMENTARY

The B-52H is the last serving variant of the Stratofortress. It first flew in 1960, and 102 were delivered between May 1961 and October 1962. The aircraft is USAF’s only nuclear cruise missile carrier. Multimission capabilities include long-range precision strike, CAS, air interdiction, defense suppression, and maritime surveillance. Litening and Sniper targeting pods have been added. The overall B-52 System Improvements project is replacing key obsolescent components. The Combat Network Communications Technology (CONECT) program is replacing cockpit displays and comms and enabling machine-to-machine tasking/ retargeting. The first CONECT airframe was redelivered in 2014. CNS/ATM replaces the

B-52’s analog systems with digital systems. The Internal Weapons Bay Upgrade enables internal smart weapon carriage. The first six Conventional Rotary Launchers were delivered under the accelerated program in 2016. The CRL roughly doubles smart weapon payloads, while reducing drag and increasing range. The upgrade supports transition from CALCM to the AGM-158B JASSM-ER long-range cruise missile. Future weapons include the GBU-54 Laser JDAM. Thirty B-52s are undergoing conventional weapon-only modifications to comply with the New START nuclear arms reduction agreement. FY17 efforts will replace the bomber’s obsolescent radar with a reliable, modern, off-the-shelf system, add low-latency, jam-resistant C2/comms, and upgrade BLOS voice/data capability to preserve current capabilities.

# FIGHTER & ATTACK AIRCRAFT

# ■ A-10 THUNDERBOLT II

Brief: Twin-engine aircraft designed for CAS against a wide range of ground targets, including tanks and armored vehicles.

# COMMENTARY

The A-10C is an A-10A with precision engagement modifications, including color cockpit MFDs, hands-on throttle and stick, digital stores management, improved fire-control system, GPS guided weapons, Litening/Sniper pods, advanced data links, and integrated sensors. A-10C deployed to combat for the first time in 2007. It combines a large, diverse weapons payload, long loiter times, austere airfield capability, maneuverability, and wide combat radius. Using night vision and targeting pods, it is capable of operating under 1,000-ft ceilings in darkness. The aircraft has 11 hardpoints for up to 16,000 lb of ordnance. Its $3 0 ~ \mathsf { m m }$ gun can destroy heavy armor, and its titanium cockpit tub protects the pilot. Current upgrades include advanced IFF and open architecture software to allow quick integration of future weapons and sensors. The last of 278 aircraft were upgraded with Helmet Mounted Cueing System (HMCS) in 2015, and USAF is pursuing wing replacement beyond the initial 173 aircraft program ending in FY16. Integration of the Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS) recently added carriage of 98 low-collateral, laser guided rockets, immediately arming A-10s in combat over Iraq and Syria. USAF reversed early retirement plans in favor of retaining the A-10 in service until 2022. FY17 funds support Lightweight Airborne Recovery System/Combat Survivor Evader Locator (LARS/CSEL) upgrades to enhance the A-10’s ability to locate and aid recovery of downed aircrew.

# ■ F-15 EAGLE

Brief: Supersonic, highly maneuverable, allweather fighter designed to swiftly gain and maintain combat air superiority.

# COMMENTARY

The F-15 was the world’s dominant air superiority fighter for more than 30 years. F-15C/Ds began replacing F-15A/Bs in 1979 and offered superior maneuverability and acceleration, range, weapons, and avionics. It incorporates internal EW countermeasures and an added 2,000 lb of internal fuel (with provision for CFTs). The aircraft accounted for 34 of 37 USAF air-to-air kills during combat debut in Desert Storm. The final 43 production aircraft received the F-15E’s APG-70 radar, and the Multistage Improvement Program enhanced tactical capabilities. The F-15C/D is undergoing vital improvements, including new AESA radar and self defenses, needed to survive and fight in future, contested airspace. The first APG-63(V)3 AESA-modified F-15 was delivered in 2010, and the Eagle Passive/Active Warning Survivability System (EPAWSS) engineering development contract was awarded in 2016. EPAWSS initially replaces the current, obsolete system. A second phase will add a towed decoy/angled countermeasure capability. A total of 214 aircraft will be upgraded to augment the limited F-22 fleet. Additional upgrades include jam-resistant Mode 5-compliant IFF and higher capacity, jam-resistant Link 16. Development includes infrared search and track (IRST) to discreetly detect, track, and engage air targets, and advanced data links to enhance interoperability with fifth generation aircraft. New digital cockpit displays will fully exploit AESA capabilities (common with the F-15E). USAF is seeking to rewing the fleet to extend its service life to 2045. The service reduced retirements over the FYDP to support increased European deployments.

# ■ F-15E STRIKE EAGLE

Brief: Heavily modified two-seat dual-role F-15 designed for all-weather deep interdiction and attack as well as air-to-air combat.

# COMMENTARY

F-15E is an upgraded heavyweight, multirole F-15 capable of sustaining nine Gs throughout the flight envelope. It entered combat during Desert Storm in 1991. F-15E’s large, varied load of precision weapons and $2 0 \mathsf { m m }$ cannon gives it potent ground attack capability. Radar guided and IR-homing missiles give it an additional airto-air capability. Its advanced cockpit controls and displays include a wide-field-of-view HUD and helmet mounted cockpit-cueing, and its avionics permit all-weather day/night engagement. The F-15E carries LANTIRN, Sniper, and Litening ATPs on dedicated pylons. A SAR pod provides surveillance/reconnaissance capability. The aircraft are equipped with Link 16 and ARC-210 BLOS satcom. Ongoing upgrades include new APG-82(V)1 AESA radar and Eagle Passive/Active Warning Survivability System (EPAWSS) to replace its obsolete self-defense suite. The combined EPAWSS engineering development contract for all F-15 variants was awarded in 2016. USAF increased development, test, and evaluation funding for FY17 to support EPAWSS, AESA integration, new central computer and cockpit displays (in common with the F-15C/D), jam-resistant Link 16, Mode 5 IFF, and passive IR search and track (IRST). Fatigue testing is underway to determine SLEP requirements to reach 2035 or beyond.

# ■ F-16 FIGHTING FALCON

Brief: Highly maneuverable multirole fighter proven in air-to-air combat, SEAD, and air-tosurface attack.

# COMMENTARY

The F-16 comprises 50 percent of USAF’s fighter fleet and is among the most maneuverable fighters ever built. It is a lightweight fighter capable of carrying the majority of PGMs. The F-16 entered combat during the 1991 Gulf War. The F-16C/D was introduced in 1984, at Block 25. It featured cockpit, airframe, and core avionics upgrades and added the increased-range APG-68 radar and AMRAAM. Block 30/32 added next stage improvements, new engines, and weapons including HARM. Block 40/42 delivered in 1988 introduced the LANTIRN pod, enabling automatic terrain following and high-speed night/all-weather penetration. It also introduced wide-angle HUD, increased takeoff weight, expanded flight envelope, and higher G limits. Block 50/52 delivered in 1991 is optimized for SEAD, employing HARM and a longer range radar. It added the uprated F110- GE-129 and F100-PW-229 engines, upgradable cockpit, Sniper/Litening ATPs, and ROVER to coordinate with strike controllers. Blocks 40 through 52 were cockpit-standardized with a new color MFD, modular mission computer,

Helmet Mounted Integrated Targeting (HMIT), and Link 16. Block 30/32 aircraft are still undergoing mods. Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System (A-GCAS) was added in 2014. Future efforts include adding air collision avoidance and merging the two systems, as well as developing a similar system that is compatible with early block, analog flight-control systems. SLEP development efforts to extend fatigue life beyond 10,000 hours began in 2016. FY17 funds support modifying AESA radar retrofits to allow NORAD alert aircraft to counter cruise missile threats. JASSM-ER integration and high-capacity, secure, and civil-compliant comm/data link mods are ongoing.

F-22 Raptor

# ■ F-22 RAPTOR

Brief: Fifth generation, multirole fighter designed to penetrate advanced air defenses and achieve air dominance.

# COMMENTARY

The F-22 is built for day, night, and adverse weather full-spectrum operations. The world’s most advanced fighter, it combines stealth, supercruise, high maneuverability, and integrated avionics. Its integrated avionics and data links permit simultaneous multitarget engagement. Advanced flight controls and thrust vectoring high-performance engines lend great maneuverability. Features include six LCD color cockpit displays, APG-77 radar, EW system with RWR and missile launch detector, JTIDS, IFF system, laser gyroscope inertial reference, and GPS. The Raptor flew its first operational sortie during Noble Eagle in 2006 and debuted in combat during Inherent Resolve over Iraq and Syria in 2014. Four aircraft successfully employed 1,000-lb JDAMs against ISIS ground targets during the aircraft’s first combat sortie. Ongoing upgrades include the Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability Maturation Program (RAMMP), software Increment 3.1, and tactical capability improvements, which collectively retrofit combat-coded F-22s with enhanced ground attack, air-to-air, and networking. RAMMP is adding AIM-9X-capable launch rails, and the next software package will add high resolution ground mapping SAR, threat geolocation, EA capability, and integration of SDB I, AIM-120D, and AIM-9X. Five test aircraft are modified to 3.2 standards to begin operational testing in FY17, and fleetwide mods are slated to begin FY18. Additional upgrades include engine safety, performance, and maintainability mods, phase two structural upgrades to extend fleet life, and improved ISR and comms. USAF is exploring options to improve situational awareness and targeting with development of the Raptor Helmet Mounted Display and Cueing System (RHMDCS) and to upgrade training airframes to combat-coded specifications.

# ■ F-35 LIGHTNING II

Brief: Stealthy, next generation, joint service strike aircraft.

# COMMENTARY

The F-35 is a joint and multinational program aimed at fielding an affordable, highly common family of next generation strike fighters. USAF’s F-35A will replace F-16 and A-10 fleets with a stealthy, multirole fighter capable of penetrating advanced enemy air defenses and striking targets at will. The F-35A carries up to 18,000 lb of weapons on 10 stations, including four internal bays (for maximum stealth) and six additional wing-mounted pylons. The service received its first production aircraft—AF-7—in 2008. USAF most recently awarded LRIP Lot 9 and Lot 10 covering delivery of 85 F-35As to the service through 2020. The Marine Corps declared F-35 IOC in 2015. USAF reached IOC at Hill AFB, Utah, on Aug. 2, 2016, with the first aircraft upgraded with Block 3I software. Block 3I improves the baseline Block 2B software, adding 89 percent of the code needed for full combat capability. The Block 3F software, in testing, will enable full combat capability, adding a range of precision guided munitions. Fiscal 2017 launches Block 4 development to add new weapons and sensors, improve the F-35’s EW capabilities, and integrate nuclear weapons beyond 2020. A fuel system flaw partially grounded the fleet last year, but jets were cleared to resume interim flight until depotlevel mods are completed. Lockheed Martin delivered the 100th F-35A to Luke AFB, Ariz., on Aug. 26, 2016, and FY17 funding supports procurement of 43 F-35As.

All AC-130U weapons can be subordinated to the APQ-180 digital fire-control radar, FLIR, or all-light-level television (ALLTV) for adverse weather attack operations. Rockwell converted the initial 13 AC-130Us in 1994-95, and Boeing more recently converted four more, all dubbed “Spooky” in reference to the early AC-47D gunship. The command retired a single nonstandard AC-130U in 2015, before halting phaseout. AFSOC is retaining 16 legacy AC-130Us and accelerating center wing box replacements to extend serviceability and meet high operational demands until replaced by AC-130Js. Ongoing upgrades include Enhanced Situational Awareness (ESA) program mods to provide near realtime intel and data fusion of threat detection, avoidance, geolocation, and adversary-emitter identification. Other upgrades include replacing obsolescent mission computers and EO/IR sensors with a new high-definition suite, and GPS updates. All AC-130Us serve with the 1st Special Operations Wing at Hurlburt Field, Fla.

# ■ AC-130W STINGER II

Brief: Modified C-130H variant primarily de

signed for armed overwatch, reconnaissance, and direct ordnance delivery to support ground troops.

# COMMENTARY

The AC-130W is a C-130H significantly modified with improved navigation, threat detection, countermeasures, comms, and a standoff Precision Strike Package. The aircraft performs armed overwatch, CAS, and reconnaissance over friendly positions for threat prevention. AC-130Ws also provide strike coordination, nontraditional ISR, and C2. PSP mod includes a mission management console, communications suite, and flight deck hardware. The airframes were originally converted as MC-130W Combat Spear for SOF infiltration/exfiltration and in-flight refueling. Aircraft were redesignated Dragon Spear with the addition of the roll on/roll off PSP to fill a need for more gunships in 2010. The aircraft was redesignated AC-130W Stinger II after further enhancements in 2012. New AC-130Js will eventually replace the AC-130Ws, which average more than 24 years old. Ongoing upgrades include Enhanced Situational Awareness (ESA) program mods to provide near real-time intel and data fusion capability, including threat detection, avoidance, geolocation, and adversary-emitter identification. SDB was added in 2012, and all aircraft are slated for retrofit with a 105 mm gun in common with the AC-130U/J fleets. Ongoing weapons integration includes Hellfire and Laser Guided SDB (LSDB). Future development include enhanced IR suppression to reduce engine heat signatures. A single aircraft will be modified with a high-energy laser (in place of the $3 0 \mathsf { m m }$ gun) to develop future AC-130J armament.

All models are capable of aerial refueling as a receiver and supplier. Aircraft are capable of airdrop, using Joint Precision Airdrop System, and operating from austere and unmarked strips. Fourteen MC-130E were converted from C-130Es. MC-130Ps (previously HC-130N/P) are a specialized aerial refueling version designed to support SOF and were delivered in the mid-1980s. MC-130H were converted from base-model C-130H to supplement the existing Combat Talon I and Combat Shadow fleets in the late 1980s and early 1990s. MC130Hs have integrated glass cockpit and a modernized pod-based aerial refueling system. Ongoing MC-130H mods include center wing replacement, new mission computers, GPS upgrades, permanent Sigint installation, threat warning upgrades, and new lightweight armor. AFSOC is replacing the MC-130P with the new MC-130J, and the California ANG is the variant’s sole remaining user. MC-130Hs from Kirtland AFB, N.M., consolidated to Hurlburt Field, Fla., in 2016, and Kadena AB, Japan, is retaining several H models only until its MC130Js achieve TF/TA capability.

# COMMENTARY

of rotary wing aircraft, and resupply of special operations forces.

MC-130J is a specialized tanker variant of the C-130J, for clandestine intrusion into hostile areas to provide air refueling of SOF helicopters and CV-22s. MC-130J enables infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply. Mods include fully integrated INS/GPS, color cockpit LCDs, NVG lighting, HUDs, integrated defensive systems, digital moving map display, EO/IR system, dual secure voice/data satcom, enhanced cargo handling, and extended-life wings. MC-130Js have secondary leaflet and rubber raiding craft aerial delivery roles for psyops and littoral ingress/ egress. Crew is smaller than legacy models, but includes CSO/auxiliary flight deck stations to handle aerial refueling (otherwise performed by the flight engineer). Loadmasters handle remaining flight engineer/comms functions. The aircraft was redesignated from Combat Shadow II to Commando II in March 2012 and is replacing the MC-130P. European-based MC-130Js will move from RAF Mildenhall, UK, to Spangdahlem AB, Germany, as part of overall force structure adjustments. FY17 funding supports procurement of six airframes. Ongoing upgrades include new Radio Frequency Countermeasure (RFCM) EW system. The MC-130J currently lacks terrain-following/terrain-avoidance (TF/ TA) capability. An MC-130J completed several test sorties with experimental winglets to explore potential efficiency enhancements in 2016. Development and integration of the Silent Knight TF/TA radar will enable low-level nighttime and adverse weather flight with low probability of detection to fully replace legacy platforms.

# ■ E-3 SENTRY

# ISR/BM/C3 AIRCRAFT

Brief: Modified Boeing 707 for all-weather air surveillance, command, and control.

# COMMENTARY

The Sentry airborne warning and control system (AWACS) is a heavily modified Boeing 707- 320B capable of surveilling airspace in excess of 200 miles from surface to stratosphere. AWACS coordinates theater air operations in direct subordination to joint/combined air and space operations centers. It can simultaneously conduct C2, BM, and target detection/tracking. E-3Bs were upgraded to Block 30/35 standards in 2001. USAF is equipping the aircraft with interim IFF to keep the variant airspace-compliant until Block 40/45 upgrade or divestiture. Block 40/45 aircraft are redesignated E-3G. The upgrade is the most comprehensive AWACS enhancement to date and improves tracking/ identification, system reliability, and life-cycle cost. Mods include open architecture computing, operator workload reduction, new consoles, improved electronic support measures (ESM), and passive surveillance capability. DRAGON (Diminishing Manufacturing Sources Replacement of Avionics for Global Operations and Navigation) upgrades add a digital cockpit and next generation CNS/GATM. The first of 24 upgraded airframes was delivered to Tinker AFB, Okla., on Jan. 9, 2017. Future upgrades include the Multifunctional Information Distribution System/Joint Tactical Radio System (MIDS/JTRS). Six airframes are undergoing Block 40/45 modification under LRIP, and the first was redelivered in 2014. USAF is upgrading 18 more under full-rate production. Seven AWACS slated for divestiture will be retained to FY19 due to operational demand.

# ■ E-4 NATIONAL AIRBORNE OPERATIONSCENTER

Brief: Militarized Boeing 747 modified as airborne operations and nuclear command and control center.

# COMMENTARY

The E-4B is a highly survivable flying C3 center enabling national leaders to direct nuclear and conventional forces, execute emergency war orders, and coordinate civil response actions. It is hardened against the effects of nuclear explosions, including electromagnetic pulse (EMP). Comm and data processing capabilities include EHF Milstar satellite, six-channel International Maritime Satellite, and a triband radome houses SHF communications antenna. All aircraft underwent Block 1 upgrades, enhancing electronic and communications infrastructure with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) systems. Ongoing development includes replacing Milstar data links with AEHF compatible FAB-T. Other developments include replacing the VLF/LF transmitter and CNS/ATM with civil compliant systems. FY17 funds support purchasing the first production Low Frequency Transmit System (LFTS) kit. USAF is drafting requirements to replace E-4B with a more modern platform. Airframes are viable to 2039, but phaseout of commercial 747-200s hampers sustainment beyond 2020. The fleet transferred from ACC to AFGSC in 2016, aligning with its primarily nuclear role.

# ■ E-8 JSTARS

Brief: Modified Boeing 707 for locating, classifying, and tracking moving ground targets.

# COMMENTARY

E-8C primarily provides theater commanders ground surveillance data to support tactical operations. E-8 evolved from the Army/Air Force Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System program. The first two aircraft deployed for Desert Storm while still under development, and early airframes were eventually retrofit to Block 20 production standards, featuring more powerful computers, an Internet protocol local area network, and BLOS connectivity. JSTARS is equipped with a canoe-shaped radome under the forward fuselage housing a 24-ft-long side-looking phased array radar antenna. It can locate, classify, and track vehicles at distances exceeding 124 miles, and recent refinements enable human-target tracking. Target data is transmitted via data link to ground stations or other aircraft. USAF halted modernization funds and retired the program’s T-3 systems integration testbed aircraft in 2015. The service issued a request for proposals to replace the E-8 with a more affordable business-class airframe in late 2016. A contract for 17 aircraft is planned in 2018, with IOC slated for FY24. USAF postponed retiring five aircraft to FY19. Fleetwide retirement depends on full fielding of a replacement.

# COMMENTARY

The EC-130 is the Air Force’s primary psychological warfare platform, providing military information support operations (MISO) and civil affairs broadcast. Commando Solo aircraft conducted psychological operations in almost every

US war or contingency operation since 1980. The EC-130J Commando Solo is equipped with radio and color television broadcast equipment for psychological warfare, enhanced navigation, self-protection, and an aerial refueling receptacle. With transition to the EC-130J, USAF added a new, secondary mission resulting in a second variant. Three heavily modified EC-130J Commando Solo aircraft serve as a standard broadcasting station for psychological warfare operations. Four EC-130Js, dubbed Super J, perform secondary, low-cost EA role on top of their special operations mobility (SOFFLEX) mission. SOFFLEX includes personnel and cargo airdrop, combat offload, and infiltration/ exfiltration. FY17 funding supports demodification of three Super Js to make them multimission capable, and procurement of three of the seven planned roll-on/roll-off Removable Airborne MISO Systems (RAMS). RAMS is based on the Army’s Fly Away Broadcast System and will allow the Super J to supplement Commando Solo. All variants are operated by the ANG’s 193rd Special Operations Wing.

# ■ U-2 DRAGON LADY

Brief: Manned, single-engine, high-altitude, long endurance ISR aircraft.

# COMMENTARY

The U-2 is the Air Force’s manned high-altitude ISR platform, capable of carrying multiple, simultaneous intelligence sensors. U-2 can carry a variety of advanced optical, multispectral EO/IR, SAR, Sigint, and other payloads. U-2 was initially designed in the 1950s, but current U-2s date to the 1980s when the production was reopened to produce the larger and more capable TR-1. S model conversions began in 1994, and all current aircraft are Block 20 configured, featuring a glass cockpit, digital autopilot, modernized EW system, and updated data links. Sensor upgrades include the ASARS-2A SAR sensor, SYERS-2A multispectral EO/IR imagery system, and enhanced Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP). The legacy optical bar camera is still in use, providing broad-area synoptic imagery coverage. U-2’s modular payload and open system architecture allow new sensors to be rapidly fielded to meet emerging needs. USAF planned to start retiring the fleet in FY16 due to budget constraints. Congress stipulated the RQ-4 Block 30 achieve sensor parity with the U-2 before the fleet is phased out, delaying retirement to FY19. U-2s are heavily tasked meeting operational demands, and retirement would reduce high altitude ISR capacity by 50 percent. Future funds are limited to flight safety and sustainment, unless critical to national security. Ongoing upgrades include ASARS development, integration, and testing, as well as EO sensor and EW system upgrades, and flight safety and airspace compliance mods. A two-seat TU-2S was destroyed in a crash near Beale AFB, Calif., on Sept. 20, 2016.

# ■ HC-130N/P KING

Brief: Extended-range C-130H tanker variant converted for personnel recovery in hostile environments, deploying pararescue (PJ), and helicopter in-flight refueling.

# COMMENTARY

The HC-130N/P conducts operations to austere airfields and denied territory for expeditionary, all-weather personnel recovery operations, including airdrop, air-land, helicopter air-to-air refueling, and forward area refueling point missions. Secondary roles include humanitarian assistance, disaster response, security cooperation/aviation advisory, emergency medical evacuation, noncombatant evacuation, and spaceflight support for NASA. Features include integrated GPS/INS navigation package, NVG lighting, FLIR, radar/missile warning receivers, chaff/flare dispensers, and data-burst communications. Both models suffer airworthiness, maintainability, and operational limitations and are being replaced by HC-130J. Corrosion issues forced early retirement of a significant part of the remaining fleet. Serviceable aircraft were diverted from storage to fill an operational gap at Patrick AFB, Fla., until recapitalization with the HC-130J. The last Active Duty HC-130N/P assigned to AETC at Kirtland AFB, N.M., retired Oct. 4, 2016. The Alaska ANG also retired its final HC-130N/P in January 2017, before reequipping with the HC-130J.

ity. In 2011 Boeing was awarded a contract for 179 KC-46A tankers, the first increment (KC-X) toward replacing USAF’s KC-135R fleet. Compared to the 50-year-old KC-135, the KC-46A will have enhanced capabilities, including more fuel capacity, improved efficiency, and enhanced cargo and AE capability. Like the KC-10, it will employ both an advanced refueling boom and independently operating hose and drogue system. The program’s provisioned 767-2C prototype (without refueling boom) flew in late 2014, and the full-up KC-46A flew for the first time from Everett, Wash., Sept. 25, 2015. Japan became the KC-46’s first export customer in 2015. Four airframes are supporting developmental testing at Edwards AFB, Calif., and have completed more than 1,000 combined flight test hours to date. Operational testing is scheduled to begin in April 2017. Higher than expected stress loads encountered during C-17 refueling-compatibility trials forced a limited boom redesign before clearance for LRIP. The service awarded LRIP Lot 1 and Lot 2 contracts for seven and 12 aircraft respectively in August 2016 and a follow-on Lot 3 contract for 15 tankers in January 2017. Eighteen airframes are slated for delivery ahead of planned IOC, which slipped six months to January 2018 due to boom mods.

# ■ KC-135 STRATOTANKER

Brief: Medium-range tanker aircraft capable of cargo and AE support.

# COMMENTARY

The KC-135 has been the mainstay of the USAF tanker fleet for some 50 years. It is similar in size and appearance to commercial 707 aircraft but designed to military specifications. The current KC-135R variant first flew in October 1982 and deliveries began in July 1984. Twenty were modified with the Multipoint Refueling System (MPRS), allowing the use of hose-and-drogue pods on each wing to simultaneously refuel two NATO or US Navy aircraft. Non-MPRS modified KC-135s use a single drogue adapter attached to the boom. Upgrades include a modernized digital flight deck. New Global Air Traffic Management upgrades were completed in 2011. Link 16 capability was also added to a limited number of aircraft. KC-135Ts are upgraded and sustained alongside the KC-135R fleet under common programs. USAF plans to modify 395 aircraft with Block 45 upgrades through 2026. These include additional glass cockpit display for engine instrumentation, a radar altimeter, advanced autopilot, and flight director to replace obsolescent systems. The first Block 45 aircraft was redelivered in 2013, and the 45th aircraft was turned over Jan. 27, 2017. Fleet service life is projected out to 2040.

# AIRLIFT AIRCRAFT

# ■ C-5 GALAXY

Brief: Air refuelable long-range strategic cargo transport for massive/outsize cargo.

# COMMENTARY

The C-5 is USAF’s largest airlifter and one of the world’s largest aircraft. It can carry unusually heavy cargo over intercontinental ranges. It can take off and land in relatively short distances and taxi on substandard surfaces, if required. The Galaxy’s front and rear cargo doors permit simultaneous drive-through loading/unloading. A total of 81 C-5As were delivered and underwent major wing modifications to extend their service lives but are now being retired. The C-5B first flew in 1985 and embodies all C-5A improvements, including improved turbofans, color weather radar, and triple INS. The first C-5B was delivered in January 1986, and some are equipped with a defensive system. Two C-5As were modified to carry outsize space cargo and redesignated C-5Cs. USAF was upgrading the C-5 fleet through a combination of the Avionics Modernization Program (AMP)—completed in 2011—and Reliability Enhancement and Reengining Program (RERP), ongoing. Upgraded aircraft are designated C-5M Super Galaxy and incorporate new GE CF6-80C2 (F138-GE-100) turbofans, with 200 percent increased thrust, along with avionics and structural reliability fixes. USAF plans to modernize 52 C-5s to C-5M standards, including 49 B models, two C models, and one C-5A. The final C-5B departed for conversion to Super Galaxy standards in January 2017. FY17 funds support CNS/ATM upgrades aided by a new core mission computer and weather radar. Other mods include modernized IR countermeasures and lavatory redesign to address leaking/corrosion issues.

# ■ UH-1 HUEY/IROQUOIS

Brief: Utility helicopter for missile field security, pilot training, and executive airlift.

# COMMENTARY

The UH-1N aircraft initially provided search and rescue capabilities before replacing UH1Hs in the ICBM field security and support role. UH-1Ns provide administrative lift to US National Capital Region and PACAF officials from JB Andrews, Md., and Yokota AB, Japan, respectively, and support aircrew survival training at Fairchild AFB, Wash. The TH-1H fleet provides Air Force helicopter pilot training at Fort Rucker, Ala. USAF converted all single-engine UH-1H models to twin-engine TH-1H variants, extending their service lives by at least 20 years. With termination of the earlier Common Vertical Lift Support Program (CVLSP), AFGSC is modifying its UH-1N with NVG-compatible cockpit, upgraded sensors, and safety and sustainment improvements to bridge the gap to a replacement helicopter. USAF launched the UH-1N Replacement Program in 2016 to recapitalize the fleet with up to 84 off-the-shelf helicopters suitable for mission-specific modification. Competitive contract award is planned for 2018, with operational testing beginning as early as FY19.

# ■ T-38 TALON

Brief: Twin-engine, supersonic advanced jet trainer.

# COMMENTARY

The T-38 was the first supersonic trainer aircraft and is primarily used by AETC for advanced JSUPT fighter/bomber tracks and Introduction to Fighter Fundamentals. The aircraft is used to teach supersonic techniques, aerobatics, formation, night and instrument flying, and cross-country/low-level navigation. The T-38 is also used by the USAF Test Pilot School to train test pilots and flight-test engineers and by ACC and AFGSC as a companion trainer to maintain pilot proficiency. ACC uses regenerated T-38s as dedicated aggressor aircraft for F-22 training. T-38Bs are equipped with a gunsight and centerline hardpoint for mounting external stores including ECM pod/practice bomb dispensers. Aircraft were redesignated T-38Cs after avionics modernization that added a glass cockpit and HUD, color MFDs, mission computer, integrated INS/GPS, and reshaped air intakes. T-38Cs were delivered from 2002 to 2007. Sustainment measures include replacement of major engine components to improve reliability and maintainability. Full fleet replacement is not projected until 2034, and USAF is additionally extending aircraft. The structural renewal effort is the most intensive in the T-38’s history, replacing major longerons, bulkheads/formers, intakes, internal skins, and structural floors. The first airframe was redelivered in 2015. Additional upgrades include wingset replacement, digital avionics upgrades, replacement HUD, VHF nav/comms, airspace compliance, safety, and low-cost mods. USAF aims to field the next generation T-X aircraft with initial capability in 2024.

# REMOTELY PILOTED AIRCRAFT

# ■ MQ-1 PREDATOR

Brief: Medium-altitude, long-endurance RPA, with ISR and strike capability.

# COMMENTARY

The MQ-1 is a multimission weaponized RPA with near real-time FMV and multispectral targeting with combined laser designator/illuminator and EO/IR sensors. The fully operational system comprises four air vehicles, GCS, satellite link, and about 55 personnel for 24-hour operations. RQ-1 became a fully USAF system in 1996, and the designation was changed to MQ-1 (denoting multimission capability) when it was armed with the Hellfire missile in 2002. USAF forward deploys launch and recovery element (LRE) systems and support personnel for takeoff and landing operations, while the CONUS-based GCSs conduct the mission via extended BLOS satcom data link. USAF received its last MQ-1B in March 2011, but continues to fund GCS and airframe mods. The service is also integrating the advanced Airborne Cueing and Exploitation System Hyperspectral Sensor (ACES HY) to fill ISR shortfalls. USAF is increasingly relying on contractors to operate MQ-1s for nonkinetic ISR support. The MQ-1 is being replaced by the MQ9, and USAF plans to retire the fleet by 2018.

# ■ RQ-4 GLOBAL HAWK

Brief: High-altitude, long-range, long-endurance RPA sensor platform.

# COMMENTARY

The Global Hawk is primarily a long-endurance, high altitude, “deep look” ISR platform to complement satellite and manned strategic ISR. The weapon system consists of an aircraft with an integrated sensor suite, launch and recovery element (LRE), mission control element (MCE), and communications and mission planning equipment. Block 20 aircraft were initially delivered as an imagery intelligence (Imint) platform incorporating the Enhanced Integrated Sensor Suite (EISS). Four airframes were subsequently converted to EQ-4B communications relay platforms with the Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN), and three remain active. The Block 30 variant is a multi-intelligence platform equipped with EO/IR, SAR, as well as Sigint sensors and has supported combat operations worldwide. The Block 40 ground surveillance platform is equipped with the Multiplatform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MPRTIP) sensor suite that incorporates AESA and SAR to simultaneously gather stationary target imagery and detect and track moving ground targets as well as cruise missiles. USAF reversed its FY13 decision to divest the Block 30 fleet, electing to instead retire the U-2 in 2019. Congress stipulated the RQ-4 demonstrate sensor parity with the U-2 before divestment. The developmental universal payload adapter will enable carriage of several U-2-unique sensors, including the MS-177 electro-optical sensor and wet-film Optical Bar Camera. Initial sensor capability is planned circa 2017. Planned improvements include weather-avoidance radar and anti-icing system for all-weather operations, Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP) increment I Sigint improvement, reliability improvements, and airspace compatibility mods.

RQ-4 Global Hawk   
TSgt. Christopher Boitz/USAF

The QF-4 became USAF’s Full-scale Aerial Target (FSAT) system in 1997 and was primarily used to support missile and weapon systems development, testing, and evaluation. The majority of flights were conducted with a safety pilot in the cockpit to facilitate air combat training and evaluation. For live-shot weapons tests or training, QF-4s flew in the “not under live local operator” (NULLO) control configuration, equipped with explosive charges to terminate flight if damaged, and 16 to 20 kills were conducted annually. Retired F/RF-4 airframes were refurbished and converted to drone configuration by BAE Systems, with installation of drone specific equipment including remote control, missile telemetry and scoring, and safe flight-termination systems. The final QF-4 was converted from an RF-4C and delivered in November 2013. QF-16s began replacing QF-4s in 2015. Holloman AFB, N.M., launched the final unmanned QF-4 sortie Aug. 17, 2016, ahead of the aircraft’s retirement on Dec. 21, 2017. The remaining airframes will be used as ground targets.

# STRATEGIC WEAPONS

# ■ AGM-86 AIR LAUNCHED CRUISE MISSILE(ALCM)

Brief: Nuclear or conventional armed small, air launched, subsonic air vehicle.

# COMMENTARY

ALCM is programmed to conduct strategic attack—nuclear or conventional—on surface targets. Its small radar signature and lowlevel flight capability enhance the missile’s effectiveness. The nuclear AGM-86B was the first production version. A total of 1,715 were delivered through 1986. USAF is to cut inventory to 528 and consolidate it at Minot AFB, N.D. The conventional AGM-86C, called CALCM, was first delivered in 1987, and few remain in the inventory. It was operationally employed for the first time in Desert Storm and widely used in subsequent operations. CALCM is capable of adverse weather, day/night, air-to-surface, accurate, standoff strike capability at ranges greater than 500 miles. Block 1A enhancements offer improved accuracy and increased immunity to electronic jamming. The AGM-86D is CALCM’s Block II penetrator version with AUP3(M) warhead. It provides standoff capability against hardened, deeply buried targets and was successfully used in Afghanistan. ALCM is undergoing a SLEP to stretch its in-service life to 2030 to allow for planned replacement by the Long-Range Standoff (LRSO) missile. USAF released a request for proposal for the LRSO in 2016 and plans to field the nuclear missile by the late 2020s, possibly followed by a conventional derivative thereafter.

# ■ B61 THERMONUCLEAR BOMB

Brief: Air-dropped nuclear freefall weapon.

# COMMENTARY

B61 is the primary strategic nuclear weapon for the B-2 bomber and equips both the F-16 and F-15E, providing forward deployed, extended deterrence to allies. The weapon was first delivered in 1966, and the most recent B61 Mod 11 introduced in 1997 adds a ground-penetrating capability, enhancing its destructive effect to destroy buried and hardened targets. The weapon incorporates several preselectable yield options, tailored to mission requirements. Work is underway on the next B61 Mod 12 life extension program (LEP), which entered developmental testing in 2012. The LEP aims to improve the safety, security, and reliability of the weapon through 2040, adding a new guided tail kit in addition to warhead upgrade/refurbishment. USAF completed inert, developmental test drops in 2015, and production engineering work was scheduled to begin in 2016. B61-12 will consolidate the B61-3, -4, -7, and -10 weapons into a single, standardized configuration. The first production example is scheduled for delivery in 2020, and integration work is planned on the B-2, F-15E, F-16, and the F-35A starting in 2018.

# ■ LGM-30 MINUTEMAN

Brief: Silo-launched, solid-fuel ICBM capable of delivering up to three thermonuclear warheads.

# COMMENTARY

Minuteman is a three-stage, solid-propellant ICBM housed in an underground silo. Minuteman III became operational in 1970, providing improved range, rapid retargeting, and the capability to place three re-entry vehicles on three targets with a high accuracy. It is the sole remaining US land-based ICBM. Major life extension program ensures viability to 2020. Ongoing mods, including updated warhead fuzes, guidance and propulsion upgrades, and modernized re-entry vehicles would extend that to 2030. AFGSC initially deployed 550, later reducing toward 400 based at Malmstrom AFB, Mont., Minot AFB, N.D., and F. E. Warren AFB, Wyo. AFGSC completed reducing its deployed ICBMs to a single warhead in 2014, under limits imposed by the New START agreement.

# LONG-RANGE STANDOFF WEAPONS

# ■ ADM-160 MINIATURE AIR LAUNCHED DECOY (MALD)

Brief: Air launched programmable electronic warfare platform designed to thwart enemy integrated air defense systems (IADS).

# COMMENTARY

MALD is a low-cost, modular, autonomous flight vehicle that mimics US or allied aircraft to enemy IADS. MALD-J adds radar jamming capability to the basic decoy platform and can operate alone or in concert with other EW platforms. The jammer version is designed as an expendable, close-in jammer to degrade and deny an early warning or acquisition radar’s ability to establish a track on strike aircraft. It also maintains the ability to fulfill the basic decoy mission. F-16 or B-52 are lead employment aircraft for MALD. USAF capped procurement in FY12, converting Lot 4 to the MALD-J variant. Plans call for 3,000, of which 2,400 are the jammer version. USAF demonstrated a new data link in 2014 to potentially enable in-flight retargeting. Operational testing revealed material durability problems with both variants and navigational accuracy problems with MALD-J in GPS degraded/denied environments. Both platforms are considered operationally effective, and software development efforts are underway to address shortcomings. USAF awarded a MALD-J contract option for Lot 10 production in 2016.

# COMMENTARY

LJDAM is a joint USAF-Navy development that combines a laser guidance kit with the GPS/ INS-based navigation of existing GBU-38 JDAM. The current LJDAM is a dual mode 500-lb guided weapon capable of attacking moving targets with precision. It was developed as an urgent operational need, and testing was completed in less than 17 months. It was first delivered in May 2008 and deployed in combat in Iraq three months later. Boeing is also developing GBU-31 and GBU-32 variants.

# ■ DEFENSE METEOROLOGICAL SATELLITE PROGRAM (DMSP)

Brief: Satellite constellation used to collect air, land, sea, and space environmental data in support of worldwide military operations.

# COMMENTARY

DMSP provides timely and high-quality weather information to strategic and tactical combat units worldwide. It uses operational linescan sensor to image cloud cover in visible and thermal IR and analyze cloud patterns. It is equipped with microwave imagers and sounders and a suite of space environment sensors that provide critical land, sea, and space environment data. Block 5D-3 improved spacecraft bus and sensors for longer and more capable missions. Six operational DMSP satellites now survey the entire Earth four times a day. The oldest operational satellite, DMSP-13, suffered an apparent electrical short and exploded, creating a cloud of debris in space in 2015. DMSP-19 most recently launched in 2014. The vehicle subsequently suffered a power failure in early 2016, rendering it uncontrollable. Data from the craft remains usable until its orbit decays. Congress canceled the DMSP program before the final spacecraft (DMSP-20) could be launched. DMSP-20 is in storage awaiting a decision to launch it as a replacement to DMSP-19 or to dispose of the vehicle. USAF is also considering requirements for a follow-on system.

# ■ DEFENSE SUPPORT PROGRAM (DSP)

Brief: Ballistic missile early warning spacecraft in geosynchronous orbit, guarding US forces and the US homeland against attack.

# COMMENTARY

DSP is a key part of North American and theater early warning systems. It is capable of detecting missile launches and nuclear detonations and was originally aimed at the Soviet military. It was used extensively in 1991 Gulf War to detect Iraqi theater missile launches against coalition forces and allies in the region. The 23rd and final DSP satellite launched in December 2007. Block 5 is the latest variant and is more survivable than predecessors. It includes a medium wavelength IR sensor for more mission utility and accommodates 6,000 detectors. Nine Block 5 satellites were deployed between 1989 and 2007. Control of the constellation was consolidated to the new Block 10 Mission Control Station at Buckley AFB, Colo., in early 2016.

# ■ GEOSYNCHRONOUS SPACE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS PROGRAM (GSSAP)

Brief: Space-based platform to track and characterize manmade objects in geosynchronous orbit to aid safety and avoidance.

# COMMENTARY

GSSAP are “neighborhood watch” satellites that augment the legacy Space Based Space Surveillance (SBSS) system. SBSS tracks and classifies manmade objects in low Earth orbit, and GSSAP extends this coverage to geosynchronous orbit. Two GSSAP satellites were launched in 2014 and attained IOC on Sept. 29, 2015. The satellites operate in neargeosynchronous orbit to effectively monitor objects and aid in preventing collisions in space. GSSAP carry EO/IR sensors and are able to maneuver to observe objects at close range and can track objects without the weather and atmospheric disruptions affecting ground systems.

# ■ SPACE BASED INFRARED SYSTEM(SBIRS)

Brief: Advanced space surveillance and missile warning system, capable of battlespace characterization and technical intelligence gathering.

# COMMENTARY

SBIRS is the follow-on to the Defense Support Program satellite. The system includes IR sensor payloads on host satellites in highly elliptical orbit (HEO), two IR sensors each on dedicated satellites in geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO), and ground assets. HEO sensor detects launch of submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) from the North Pole region and can be tasked for other IR detection missions. GEO scanning IR sensor performs the strategic missile warning mission, global technical intelligence, and initial phase for the strategic missile defense mission, providing two times the revisit rate and three times the sensitivity of DSP. USAF announced plans to allow civil use of SBIRS data to aid weather prediction, Arctic ice monitoring, and wildfire tracking. GEO-3 launched into orbit Jan. 20, 2017, after delays to validate the performance of its liquid apogee engine. GEO-4 is slated to launch in 2017. The next two GEO satellites are under contract and will eventually replace the oldest two on orbit.

By tradition, anyone with five official aerial victory credits is an ace. In compiling this list of aces who flew with the US Air Force and predecessor organizations (the Air Service, Air Corps, and Army Air Forces), Air Force Magazine relies on USAF’s official accounting of air-to-air aerial victory credits, which is the responsibility of the Air Force Historical Research Agency, Maxwell AFB, Ala.

This record does not include some 300 pilots credited by Eighth Air Force in World War II with destroying aircraft on the ground. Eighth was the only numbered air force to count ground kills, and the Air Force subsequently limited its official recognition of World War II aces to air-toair victories.

Robin Olds is the only USAF ace with aerial victories in both World War II and the Vietnam War.

Manuel Fernandez earned 14.5 aerial victory credits in the Korean War.

Air Force historians have kept the official records of aerial victories by USAF pilots and crew members since 1957. The Office of the Air Force Historian initially published four separate listings—for World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. The four volumes were corrected, updated, and combined into one comprehensive volume. AFHRA continues to correct records and update its listing.

The criteria that the Air Force established for awarding aerial victory credits varied from war to war.

In many cases during World War I, several aviators worked together to down a single aircraft. The Air Service awarded one whole credit to each aviator who contributed to the victory. A single victory could—and often did—result in three or four victory credits.

In World War II and Korea, the criteria were changed. The service divided one credit among all aviators who contributed to destruction of an enemy airplane. With the awarding of fractional credits, a single victory could result in no more than one credit.

The rules were changed again in the Vietnam War. When an F-4 downed an enemy aircraft, USAF would award two full aerial victory credits—one to the frontseater and one to the backseater. As in World War I, a single victory resulted in multiple victory credits.

Thus, the standards for World War II and Korea were more restrictive than those for World War I and Vietnam.

# THE CANBERRA

It began as an RAF aircraft, but USAF knew it as the B-57.

aos, March 1966: Piloting their US Air Force B-57B on a ground attack mission during the Vietnam War, Capt. Larry Mason and Capt. Jere Joyner were about to learn the meaning of the word “rugged”—both in terms of machine and man.

![](images/12ac1b6e51202ef509bf83618d36ba6ae1534a15ea3477b78a278a5a1a481256.jpg)

On their second attack run of the day, they were pounded by ground fire. Cannon shells punched into the cockpit area and blew away large sections of wing and flap surface.

With an engine on fire and backseater Joyner critically injured and losing blood, Mason nursed the B-57 home and brought it in for a landing with severe damage. Both crew and machine survived.

# Middle Child

The Canberra, or Martin B-57 as it was known within USAF, began as a design by the English Electric Co. in the UK. In the US, the Glenn L. Martin Co. license-built it, and it first entered Air Force service in 1953.

The B-57 met the Air Force requirement for a medium-range tactical bomber. It went on to fill the gap in the post-Korean War period as a nuclear-armed intruder, serve as a highly adaptable test bed for many development programs, and deliver an impressive performance during the Vietnam War.

Despite decades of solid and varied service, the B-57 is an often-overlooked USAF aircraft.

# I Was Smitten

But I knew it well. I grew up in England, near RAF Wyton, home of the Royal Air Force’s last Canberra squadrons.

My grandfather had worked on the bombers during his RAF career, and I was smitten with the plane as a child.

In my 20s, I began a series of email conversations with former crews that

had maintained and flown the Canberra. This gradually snowballed into a much larger oral history project.

Ten years later—last fall—I completed a book, The Canberra Experience, compiling recollections and photos of airmen from 11 of the many countries that flew this aircraft.

On these pages are some of the photos I collected while working on the book.

Air Force Lt. Col. Charles Leonard exits his WB-57F at a run. He had just completed more than 1,000 fl ight hours in the type. Leonard was one of the few to have fl own in all models, amassing over 5,000 hours total.

# He Asked. AFA Answered.

In 2014, Steven Beeny contacted the Air Force Association, looking for members willing to tell their personal B-57 stories for the US Air Force section of his book, The Canberra Experience. AFA obliged Beeny by sending out a blast email seeking Canberra reminiscences, and the association’s marketing director went on to ask him if he was a member—hint, hint. Beeny joined.

By the way, he reported that AFA’s call for B-57 veterans generated six replies in less than an hour. The members at right are included in Beeny’s book. —The Editors

# CHAPTER NEWS

# LANCE P. SIJAN CHAPTER

The Lance P. Sijan Chapter (Colo.) held an impressive Casino Night in February for wounded airmen in Colorado Springs, Colo. It was a “fresh new approach” to the chapter’s annual fundraiser for the Wounded Airman Program, said Colorado State President Linda Aldrich.

Some 400 people attended the event, held on the last day of the Cyberspace Symposium, which was hosted by the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association.

The chapter raised $\$ 6,000$ from door prize tickets and donations. All of that money went toward ily Programs, for the Wounded Airman Program, said Aldrich. One of the top prizes for locals was the chance to host their own mini Casino night, which came with a gaming table and a dealer. Other prizes were Cuban cigars, gift cards to stores and restaurants, and beverages. All prizes were donated by chapter members or Community Partners.

The event was such a success that other AFA chapters asked for help to host similar events, she said.

AFA Chairman of the Board F. Whitten Peters, AFA Executive Vice President Denise Hollywood, and AFA Director Emeritus Jerry White were also present.

# SHOOTING STAR CHAPTER

The Shooting Star Chapter (N.J.) heard from one of their own during a chapter meeting in February. Aviation artist Keith C. Ferris talked about his latest completed artwork, “Lightning at Sea.”

“We ask him periodically if he would like to give us a talk,” said Chapter Treasurer Howard Leach.

Ferris explained to a crowd of 20 people how he started sketching the painting on a napkin, “drawing the objects using descriptive geometry with adjustments for the horizon, [and] painting of the objects with warm and cool colors using just three basic colors,” said Leach.

This was the third and last installment of F-35 paintings commissioned by Pratt & Whitney, said Leach. The painting shows an F-35C taking off from soonto-be commissioned aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford, according to a Pratt & Whitney news release.

I don’t need more members. I need more involvement. I need more active members doing things in the community that support that AFA mission. ... Give me [fewer] members [who] are more actively engaged and I’ll turn this state upside down for AFA!

# How did you fi rst hear of AFA?

# Brothers in Arms

They were the “Flying McConnells,” three brothers from the American heartland who gained lasting fame in air battles of World War II. Thomas L., Fred J., and Edwin M. McConnell, all natives of Kansas, today lend their illustrious surname to one of the Air Force’s largest bases.

Born: April 23, 1918, Wichita, Kan.   
Died: Oct. 22, 1945, Garden Plain, Kan. Service: US Army Air Forces   
Era: World War II   
Combat: South Pacific   
Final Grade: Captain   
Years Active: 1943-45   
Occupation: US military officer

The three all grew up in Wichita and attended North High School, where they excelled in academics and sports. Fred was 24, Edwin was 21, and Thomas was 19 when they joined the Army Air Forces as aviation cadets on the same day (March 22, 1943) at Fort Riley, Kan. They trained together in California and received their pilot’s wings on the same day at Luke Field, Ariz.

# McCONNELL

# FRED JUNIOR McCONNELL

# THOMAS L. McCONNELL

The brothers were a media sensation, billed as “Three of a Kind.” All three became B-24 copilots and joined the same squadron in the South Pacific theater, where they went into action on the same day. Yet the brothers fought together for only a few months.

Second Lt. Thomas McConnell, the youngest of the three, was killed in action on July 10, 1943, on his third combat mission. His B-24 had just bombed Japan’s Kahili airfield at Bougainville and was returning to base on Guadalcanal when the bomber, in dense fog, crashed into a mountainside. All 11 crew died. Thomas was 20.

The other two McConnells survived the war. Fred flew 61 missions and attained the grade of captain only to perish on active duty after returning home. He was a military flying instructor stationed at Cook Field, Neb., and was flying to a new assignment at Garden Plain, Kan., when his aircraft on Oct. 22, 1945, struck a power line and crashed. Fred was killed instantly. He was 27.

Edwin flew 56 combat missions and returned home with a Distinguished Flying Cross. He resigned from active duty in August 1945 and spent two years as a commercial airline pilot, eventually enrolling in college and taking a job in industry. Edwin remained in the Air Force Reserve and finally ended his military career in 1981. Retired Lt. Col. Edwin McConnell died at his home in Englewood, Colo., on Sept. 1, 1997. He was 76.

On April 12, 1954, Wichita AFB, Kan., was rechristened McConnell Air Force Base in honor of Tom and Fred. Edwin was not included due to policy against naming a base after a living person. At a rededication ceremony on June 14, 1999, Edwin’s name was added.

Throughout World War II, B-29s were built at a Boeing factory adjacent to the base. McConnell became a Strategic Air Command base for B-47 bombers. Today, McConnell’s mission is to provide global reach via its many airlift and tanker aircraft.

For seven decades, U.S. Air Force pilots have taken to the skies, and Rolls-Royce has proudly supplied thousands of engines to keep them aloft. From the early V-1710 engines powering P-51 Mustangs, to the current fleet of C-130Js, CV-22s and Global Hawks powered by Rolls-Royce AE engines, our facility in Indianapolis has kept those aircraft soaring.

Congratulations for 7o years full of aerospace innovation. We've been happy to be along for the ride into the wild blue yonder.
